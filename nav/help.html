              <p>The following are some steps you can take to ensure the mod will work:</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="patch-note">Make sure you have the latest version of the mod and the latest patch for the game by Maxis. Things break and sometimes in a big way. I can't guarantee that anything will work retroactively, as I have no control over what the Maxis team changes.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">If it is a mod that uses scripts, make sure Scripts Mods are enabled in your game settings. Mods get turned off automatically after most Maxis patches, so you'll have to turn the settings back on each time such an update happens.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Make sure the mod is not too many folders deep and is not inside of a folder with the extension .zip (examples: Mods > ModName.ts4script = Correct, Mods > MyMod > ModName.ts4script = Correct, Mods > MyMod > ForSureMyMod > ModName.ts4script = Incorrect)</li>
              </ul>

            <div id="subsection-broken">
              <h4>One of your mods generates a lastexception file / your mod is breaking my game</h4>
              <ul>
                <li class="patch-note">If one of my mods is showing up in a lastexception error, you can let me know in the thread here [link to thread] and then PM me your lastexception file on the official sims forums. Please don't post its contents in the thread, unless you're sure it has no references to mods with adult content; this is just to ensure nothing rule-breaking is posted. Please keep in mind that I can't promise to respond to everything and if I do respond, the response may be that to my knowledge, the mention of the lastexception in my mod is erroneous and isn't caused by my mod. I can only give you my best guess/evaluation based on what I know about how the game works and what the file says.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">If you do suspect that a mod of mine is breaking your game, there are ways you can test this without requiring a response from me, or requiring help from another member of the community. Namely, "process of elimination." This is a highly useful process to have on hand when you are facing an issue with computers in general and works well for broken mods. First, move all of your mods to somewhere safe, leaving behind the one that you suspect is breaking the game. Now load up the game and see if you can use it without the issue you noticed. I recommend doing this on a New Game, to avoid any accidental mishaps with existing saves, where the lack of a mod causes things to disappear and you inadvertently save it in that state. If the mod works fine, you can be relatively certain that it's not the one causing the issue. You can now add back in each mod, one at a time, until you find the one that is causing the issue, adding in first the ones that seem most suspect if you have any particular suspicions (for example, based on what shows up in lastexception files).</li>

              <p>Please let me know in this thread, here: [link to thread]</p>
              <p>If I can repeat the bug in my own game, I will probably be able to fix it. Sometimes patches break little bits here and there and it's difficult to track them all down on my own, so I appreciate any reports that catch this stuff.</p>
