              <h4>How to get help</h4>
              <p>If you've tried everything I've listed below and still can't get the mod to work, the following are some steps you can take to speed up the process of getting help from me:</p>
              <p>The key is in the fact that when I try to help people with getting a mod to work, I invariably ask them standard questions. Things like "are script mods enabled?" or "are you getting any lastexception files"?</p>
              <p>The more information of this kind you can provide up-front, the less standard questions I need to go back and forth with you on. You also might find that in writing down the steps you've taken, there's some step you missed, something you forgot to try.</p>
              <p>In summary:</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="patch-note">List the steps you've tried to get the mod to work.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Share the contents of a relevant lastexception file, if it exists. (Take note of the date on when the file was created when looking to share it. If it wasn't created around the time when you were having problems, it could be related to some other mod/time entirely.)</li>
                <li class="patch-note">The more specific, the better. For example, "it won't show up" tells me nothing about the circumstances of the mod not working. Does this mean it's not in the mods list when you load up the game? Does it mean the interaction isn't on the Suspicious Lump of Clay? An example of specific might look something like: "Sorcerer Mod V2-4-7 shows up in the mod list when I load up the game, but the interaction doesn't show up on the Suspicious Lump of Clay." I recently changed it to be on a new object, the Suspicious Lump of Clay instead. If you'd said "it doesn't show up on the Lump of Clay," I might have to ask if you mean the old object or the custom one. Less ambiguity means less possibilities and less time spent on questions that lead nowhere.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Finally, please keep in mind that most of what I'm doing to try to help is narrowing down standard possibilities. I have some ability to interpret lastexception files and reason about what might be going wrong, but it's limited. If your issue is outside the scope of normal mod issues, I may not be able to help you. If it is within that scope, <a href="https://forums.thesims.com/en_US/categories/mods-bugs-issues" target="_blank">I'm probably not the only one who can help you.</a></p>
              <p>In fact, there are volunteers there who have loads more experience with common mod issues than I do and are far more active.</p>

              <h4>I can't get the mod to show up</h4>
              <p>The following are some steps you can take to ensure the mod will work:</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="patch-note">Make sure you have the latest version of the mod and the latest patch for the game by Maxis. Things break and sometimes in a big way. I can't guarantee that anything will work retroactively, as I have no control over what the Maxis team changes.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">If it is a mod that uses scripts, make sure Scripts Mods are enabled in your game settings. Mods get turned off automatically after most Maxis patches, so you'll have to turn the settings back on each time such an update happens.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Make sure the mod is not too many folders deep and is not inside of a folder with the extension .zip (examples: Mods > ModName.ts4script = Correct, Mods > MyMod > ModName.ts4script = Correct, Mods > MyMod > ForSureMyMod > ModName.ts4script = Incorrect)</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Make sure you only have one version of the mod installed at a time (the most up-to-date one). Rarely, I might have an optional add-on, but it will be specified as such on the mod's page if so.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Check for incompatibility with other mods. See the section below on lastexception files.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">If you try all of this and the mod still won't work, you can ask for help in a comment in the latest bugs thread on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/triplissims" target="_blank">Patreon</a>. Please read the section <a href="#subsection-getting-help">How to get help</a> for how best to get help from me.</li>
              </ul>

            <div id="subsection-broken">
              <h4>One of your mods generates a lastexception file / your mod is breaking my game</h4>
              <ul>
                <li class="patch-note">If one of my mods is showing up in a lastexception error, you can post its contents as a comment in the latest bugs thread on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/triplissims" target="_blank">Patreon</a>. Please keep in mind that I can't promise to respond to everything and if I do respond, the response may be that to my knowledge, the mention of the lastexception in my mod is erroneous and isn't caused by my mod. I can only give you my best guess/evaluation based on what I know about how the game works and what the file says.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">If you do suspect that a mod of mine is breaking your game, there are ways you can test this without requiring a response from me, or requiring help from another member of the community. Namely, "process of elimination." This is a highly useful process to have on hand when you are facing an issue with computers in general and works well for broken mods. First, move all of your mods to somewhere safe, leaving behind the one that you suspect is breaking the game. Now load up the game and see if you can use it without the issue you noticed. I recommend doing this on a New Game, to avoid any accidental mishaps with existing saves, where the lack of a mod causes things to disappear and you inadvertently save it in that state. If the mod works fine, you can be relatively certain that it's not the one causing the issue. You can now add back in each mod, one at a time, until you find the one that is causing the issue, adding in first the ones that seem most suspect if you have any particular suspicions (for example, based on what shows up in lastexception files).</li>

              <h4>I've noticed a bug / issue with a specific feature</h4>
              <p>Please let me know in the latest bugs thread on my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/triplissims" target="_blank">Patreon</a>.</p>
              <p>If I can repeat the bug in my own game, I will probably be able to fix it. Sometimes patches break little bits here and there and it's difficult to track them all down on my own, so I appreciate any reports that catch this stuff.</p>
              <p>When reporting a bug, please try to be as specific as possible (this helps me more easily hone in on the issue and repeat it in my own game). Example:</p>
              <p>Vague: Lightning Rod doesn't work</p>
              <p>Specific: When I use the Sorcerer spell Create Lightning Rod, the Sorcerer's animation plays and the targeted sim stops and waits, but they don't get shocked and die.</p>
              <p>In the specific version, I now know that the reported issue is that the death isn't triggering, which means the custom death interaction is probably broken somehow. In the vague version, it could be any aspect of the spell that is broken and because I don't know which one, if I fail to repeat it in my own game, I have no idea how to begin to reason about what could have lead to the issue described, since I don't even know what exactly didn't work.</p>
