              <h4>Bold Trait</h4>
              <ul>
                <li class="patch-note">Character Values (Parenthood)- Gains some Responsibility when the trait is added in live mode (e.g. during age-up).</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Special idle animation in live mode, with the same frequency as toddler trait idles (note: idle animation you see in CAS doesn't necessarily reflect what the trait's idle will be in live mode)</li>

                <li class="patch-note">Interaction- Incite Domestic Defiance (non-autonomous): Target another sim and pick what all child sims listen to the speech. Lasts 30 seconds, uninterrupted. Raises child skill Social. Gives Fun and Social Need. Success results in listeners making a mess and not autonomously cleaning while the moodlet they're given is active.

            <div id="subsection-fretful-trait">
              <h4>Fretful Trait</h4>
              <ul>
                <li class="patch-note">Character Values (Parenthood)- Gains some Emotional Control when the trait is added in live mode (e.g. during age-up).</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Special idle animation in live mode, with the same frequency as toddler trait idles (note: idle animation you see in CAS doesn't necessarily reflect what the trait's idle will be in live mode)</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Sleepy walkstyle by default (can swap to Jog walkstyle with certain Inspired moodlets, such as from playing music skillfully)</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Randomly Inspired moodlet (if both Piano and Violin skill are 5 or higher)</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Moodlet Replacement- Bad playing gives a Sad instead of Embarrassed when nearby sims hear your bad playing</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Moodlet Replacement- The Inspired moodlet from interactions like "Plunk for Inspiration" is stronger and gives the Jog walkstyle while active</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Moodlet Replacements- Cool Key Chords (Piano) and Soothing Strings (Violin) give an Inspired moodlet instead of Happy</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Interaction- Fret Studiously (autonomous): Appears on Piano and Child Violin. Functions almost identically to Practice. Mostly exists as a way to ensure that Fretful children will have some autonomy pull to use instruments, even with little to no skill.</li>

                <li class="patch-note">Interaction- [hidden] (autonomous): Can only activate if Fretful child has 5 or higher skill in both Piano and Violin. Once they do, this interaction should trigger fairly frequently, particularly if Fun Need is low. It gives an Inspired moodlet which changes the walkstyle to Jog and chooses an autonomous music interaction to perform if an instrument is available.</li>

                <li class="patch-note">Interaction- Force Laughter (autonomous): Raises child skill Creativity and Fun Need. Gives a Playful moodlet at the end.</li>

                <li class="patch-note">Special idle animation in live mode, with the same frequency as toddler trait idles (note: idle animation you see in CAS doesn't necessarily reflect what the trait's idle will be in live mode)</li>

                <li class="patch-note">Randomly Energized moodlet</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Autonomy (general)- More likely to do exercise interactions (uses autonomy from Active trait)</li>

                <li class="patch-note">Interaction- Get Hyped (autonomous): Raises child skill Motor, gives Fun Need, and an Energized moodlet at the end. Nearby sims who have the Active or Rocket trait will get an Energized moodlet.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Interaction- Drink from Sugar Stash (non-autonomous): Gives a 5 hour, +10 Energized moodlet. When this moodlet is removed, gives a 1 hour, +10 Uncomfortable moodlet (sugar crash).</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Interaction- Share Sugar Stash (non-autonomous): Target another sim with high enough relationship and share the sugar.

                <li class="patch-note">Social Sensitivity- Sensitive children will get +5 Angry from too much prolonged proximity to other sims. They need alone time. The following interactions help them cope with this.</li>

              <h4>Sleuth Trait</h4>
              <ul>
                <li class="patch-note">Character Values (Parenthood)- Gains some Responsibility when the trait is added in live mode (e.g. during age-up).</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Special idle animation in live mode, with the same frequency as toddler trait idles (note: idle animation you see in CAS doesn't necessarily reflect what the trait's idle will be in live mode)</li>

                <li class="patch-note">Interaction- Interrogate (autonomous): Target another sim (found under Mean socials) and use the brief (and high level) tactics of startling them to reveal their traits. Loses a little relationship in the process. Doesn't do much of anything if traits are already known.</li>
              </ul>
              <div class="to-top">

              <h4>Sweetie Trait</h4>
              <ul>
                <li class="patch-note">Character Values (Parenthood)- Gains some Empathy when the trait is added in live mode (e.g. during age-up).</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Special idle animation in live mode, with the same frequency as toddler trait idles (note: idle animation you see in CAS doesn't necessarily reflect what the trait's idle will be in live mode)</li>

                <li class="patch-note">Interaction- Infectious Happy Dance (autonomous): Requires Happy mood to be available. Raises child skill Motor and Social, gives Fun Need, and broadcasts an infectious virus of happiness that causes nearby sims who are also in a happy mood to start doing an Infectious Happy Dance as well; unfortunately, the viral effect ends there. If it went beyond that, you would have an army of infectiously happy hordes dancing forever. Infectious Happy Dance zombie army should totally be a thing though. One day. One day.</li>

                <li class="patch-note">Special idle animation in live mode, with the same frequency as toddler trait idles (note: idle animation you see in CAS doesn't necessarily reflect what the trait's idle will be in live mode)</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Parental Need (the "need" itself is not visible, in case you're wondering from the word "need")- Tattletale children get Tense if they're away from parents for too long. Ways that count as being around a parent include using the Follow interaction on them, using any social interaction on them, using the interaction Tell On, or the interaction Chat With Authorities.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Interaction- Follow (autonomous): Gain Fun. Gain parental need if the sim that Tattletale is following is one of Parent, Aunt, Uncle, Grandparent, or Caregiver. Gain Happy moodlet if Tattletale follows "parent" for long enough. Gain Confident moodlet if Tattletale follows "non-parent" for long enough.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Interaction- Tell On... (non-autonomous): Found under Mean socials when clicking on a sim who is one of Parent, Aunt, Uncle, Grandparent, or Caregiver. Gain parental need and Happy moodlet. Sim who is told on gets scolded and gets Angry moodlet.</li>

              </ul>
              <div class="to-top">

            </div>
            <div id="subsection-compatibility">
              <h4>Compatibility</h4>
              <p>This mod may or may not require Parenthood. The only part I'm sure about is anything relating to Character Values won't happen. I figured if you're the sort of person who'll download a Child Traits mod, you'll probably be the type who'd go for the Parenthood pack. So I didn't check the overlap extensively. If you don't have Parenthood, use at your own risk.</p>
              <p>This mod overrides a few files, which are hopefully obscure enough as to never cause conflicts:</p>
              <ul>

              <h4>Connection to Teen and Toddler Traits</h4>
              <p>The personality choices for this mod were designed both with my <a href="../mods/teen-traits-pack.html">8 Pack of Teen Exclusive Traits</a> in mind and with the default 8 Maxis Toddler Traits in mind.</p>
              <p>Each one corresponds to one of the Teen Traits and Toddler Traits, as follows (the idea being that when a Child Sim ages up, you can pick the trait that corresponds to continue the evolution of their special personality):</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="patch-note">Fussy (toddler) --> Fretful (child) --> Living Instrument (teen)</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Clingy (toddler) --> Sensitive (child) --> Emotional Conduit (teen)</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Charmer (toddler) --> Sweetie (child) --> Relentless Tease (teen)</li>

                <li class="patch-note">Wild (toddler) --> Rocket (child) --> Perpetual Motion (teen)</li>
