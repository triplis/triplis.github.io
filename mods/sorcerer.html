              <h4>How to Become a Sorcerer</h4>
              <p>To obtain the Sorcerer Trait on a particular sim, you need to go into Build Mode and place a Lump of Clay anywhere on the Lot. If you already have a Lump of Clay, you can use that one. You don't need another.</p>
              <p>The Lump of Clay has a new interaction on it: Investigate Object. The tooltip says the consequences of investigating may be permanent, but with 2.0 and beyond, you can remove the trait using the Lump of Clay.</p>
              <p>When the interaction completes, your sim will now have a new hidden trait and a Spells menu with a toggle "Show/Hide Magical Energy Tingles," even if they are as young as Toddler. Toddler and older can get the trait, but Toddlers and Child sims have a different (and very limited) experience. Teen or older gets access to all the main features of the trait.</p>
              <p>See the Toddler and Child sections respectively for information on how the trait works for them. The rest of the mod info will be based on sims who are Teen or older.</p>
              <p>Now that you have the trait, clicking on your Sim will reveal a new menu called Spells. Under Spells, you'll see a menu called "Meditate on the Spirit of Llamadeus..." Under this menu, you'll see three interactions: Ritual of Digestive Control, Ritual of Runner's Vigor, and Ritual of Forced Isolation. Hovering over each tells you what it gives you, uniquely. </p>
              <p>You can only complete one Ritual and it will define what flavor of Sorcerer you end up with, in terms of Needs. Every type gets two new Needs called Magical Connection and Alignment. These two Needs replace two of the six default Needs. The rituals and traits are as follows:</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="patch-note">Ritual of Digestive Control gives a trait called Iron Insides. With Iron Insides, Bladder and Hunger are replaced by Magical Connection and Alignment.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Ritual of Runner's Vigor gives a trait called Never Bedheader. With Never Bedheader, Hygiene and Energy are replaced by Magical Connection and Alignment. [To avoid some weird bugs, Hygiene decays very slowly instead of being locked at max. I may explore an alternative to this in the future.]</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Ritual of Forced Isolation gives a trait called Sociolite. With Sociolite, Fun and Social are replaced by Magical Connection and Alignment.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Once you've chosen a Ritual and completed it, your sim can begin being a Sorcerer!</p>
              <div class="to-top">
                <p><a href="#main-col">^</a></p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div id="subsection-alignment">
              <h4>Alignment</h4>
              <p>Alignment functions similarly to the Vampire Energy Need. It doesn't decay and it only changes based on casting Spells. Each time a Light or Dark spell is cast, Alignment increases by 10 points (Light) or decreases by 10 points (Dark), impacting your experience as a Sorcerer.</p>
              <p>Alignment impacts how fast you gain Light/Dark skill and how fast you make friends/enemies with other Sims.</p>
              <p>Spells cost 5 Magical Connection by default. As you progress in Alignment, spells go up in cost for the opposing side. It progresses at a rate of +2 cost for every 10 Alignment. For example, if you reach -50 Dark Alignment, that's 2x5=10. So now if you cast a Light Spell, it will cost 5+10=15 Magical Connection. At -100 Dark Alignment, a Light Spell will cost a total of 25 Magical Connection.</p>
              <p>If you use an Alignment-Lock Ritual (see the section <a href="#subsection-mastery">Mastery</a> for details), your spell cost for that Alignment is now 0. For example, if you reach Max Dark Alignment, Level 10 Black Arts skill, and use the Ritual of Eternity, casting Dark Spells will now cost 0 Magical Connection. Light Spells, on the other hand, will have another +25 cost, totaling it to 50 Magical Connection for each Light Spell. </p>
              <p>Locking your Alignment will lock you out of any Drain/Sacrifice Need spells of the opposing Alignment (for example, if you are Dark-Locked, you can no longer choose to Sacrifice a Need), but you will still have access to any other unlocked spells of the opposing Alignment.</p>
              <div class="to-top">
                <p><a href="#main-col">^</a></p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div id="subsection-magical-connection">
              <h4>Magical Connection</h4>
              <p>Unlike Alignment, Magical Connection works like a normal Need, with a decay rate and some consequences for letting it get too low. When it gets moderately low, you get a +3 Dazed Moodlet. When it reaches rock bottom, you get a +40 Dazed Moodlet. And if it gets too low, you won't be able to cast most spells. Like Vampire Power, Magical Connection is the "power cost" Need. Casting a spell costs you Magical Connection.</p>
              <p>To fill the Magical Connection Need, you have two key routes to doing so: Practice on your own (click on your Sim and find Practice under Dark or Light Spells), or Drain/Sacrifice a Need with another Sim (click on another Sim and find a Drain or Sacrifice option under Spells > Renew Magical Connection).</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="patch-note">Practice: Practicing will both fill the Magical Connection Need over time and increase your skill level in one of the Black Arts or White Arts, depending on which type of practice you chose.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Sacrifice a Need (White Arts)(Bonded): Example of how this works. Your Energy Need is maxed, but the target Sim is a cranky Toddler who is exhausted. You use Sacrifice Energy on the Toddler and slowly transfer your Energy over to them.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Drain a Need (Black Arts)(Bonded): Example of how this works. Your Energy Need is low and you see a partying sim cranking it on the dance floor. You use Drain Energy on that dance machine and slowly drain their Energy, giving it to yourself.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Sacrifice a Need (White Arts)(Instant)(Requires Light Alignment Lock): Works like the bonded version, with the difference that the transfer happens as soon as the interaction executes and it happens as a preset value. You drain your own need to -90 and the target's targeted Need goes to 100[full], in addition to your Magical Connection filling to full. Your chosen Need (ex: Bladder) must be 30 or higher for you to be able to drain it. To give you a rough idea of what that means, 30 is somewhere in the vicinity of 2/3rds full, visually.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Drain a Need (Black Arts)(Instant)(Requires Dark Alignment Lock): Works like the bonded version, with the difference that the transfer happens as soon as the interaction executes and it happens as a preset value. You drain the target's targeted Need to -90 and yours refills to 100[full], in addition to Magical Connection filling to full. The target's targeted Need (ex: Bladder) must be 30 or higher for you to be able to drain it. To give you a rough idea of what that means, 30 is somewhere in the vicinity of 2/3rds full, visually.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Note that for "Instant" version, the amount the Need needs to be at is a rough number chosen to be in the vicinity of "not full," without being "so low it's way too easy to do over and over." If you are draining other sims' needs a lot, you may want to be thinking about how to make sure that they can get them refilled, so that you're able to keep doing it. If you're sacrificing your own needs, you may want to be thinking about how to get them refilled in a timely manner.</p>
              <p>It's all up to you to play as you want. You can even go around draining random people if you want and gain lots of Dark Alignment points, if you're into that sort of thing.</p>

              <h4>Spells Neutral - Minion System</h4>
              <p>The Minion system operates under the pie menu category Spells > Boss. Most commands are done by targeting another sim. A couple (which I'll specify below) are used by targeting yourself and picking a sim to apply the command to.</p>
              <p>Minion Roles: Minion Roles specify what limitations are set on the minion, while the role is active. The following are the available minion roles to choose from.</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="patch-note">Dance: The minion will follow around the sim who applied the role to them and dance near them. Note: Upon loading or traveling, the minion may lose track of who to follow around. You can re-apply it if this happens by swapping to another role and then swapping back to Dance.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Guest: The minion, if on a residential lot, will treat it as if they are a welcome guest. If they are not on a residential lot, they will likely just perform whatever range of actions is normal.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Maid: The minion will only tidy things up. If there is nothing to tidy up, they will stand around in place, doing nothing.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Musician: The minion's Guitar, Violin, and Piano skills will be immediately set to max level. With this role active, they will look for instruments nearby to play songs on. If no instruments are available, they will stand around in place, doing nothing.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Painter: The minion will only paint. If no easel is available to paint, they will stand around in place, doing nothing.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Repair: The minion will only repair broken objects. If no object is available to repair, they will stand around in place, doing nothing.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Romantic: The minion will act identically to Guest, with the addition of an always active +50 Flirty moodlet, making them an easy candidate for romance.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Some general details about how Minions work:</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="patch-note">Only NPCs (uncontrolled sims) can have minion commands used on them.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Minions with a role active can be chatted with normally, though they may interrupt chatting to do whatever action is high priority for them, if available.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Minion Needs are locked at max while a role is active, so you don't need to be concerned with managing their needs.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">PlantSims and Vampires can be minions, in addition to normal sims. Sorcerers cannot.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Minions with a role active will always use the Run walkstyle, making them super efficient at getting around to perform their role. Note: Vampires may use super speed or teleport instead of Run, if it's active when they take on a minion role.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Minion roles can be applied on public lots, though they were designed with residential in mind, so they may not be all that interesting outside of the home.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">A minion will stay in its active role forever, unless: 1) You use Dismiss on it or, 2) You leave the lot and the minion leaves the role for some reason that I don't have a fix for. Minions may stick around if you travel, they may not. Expect some inconsistency with this aspect of it. Minions will leave the role if *they* travel, for sure.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Once a role has been successfully applied to a target once, that target will have a permanent trait on them that makes them a minion, even if they don't have any roles currently active. This trait can be removed with the ability Fire, explained in detail below in the special commands.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Special minion commands (these commands are always available once a minion has the special trait applied to them through applying a role at least once):</p>
              <p>Targeting the Minion</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="patch-note">Sleep: Puts the minion into a sleeping interaction. This is to allow you to go into the highest game speed, without the presence of minions screwing it up. To wake the minion from this, target them with a sorcerer and use Wake Up.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Dismiss: Forces the minion to leave the lot. In case you're wondering, this can be used on both residential and public lots.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Targeting Yourself and Picking a Sim</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="patch-note">Call Over: Works like the voodoo summon ability. Can only be used on a minion who isn't currently on the loaded neighborhood somewhere. It will bring them onto the lot, to you (they may have to walk/run to you once they spawn, so don't expect to see them instantly).</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Fire: Removes the minion trait from the minion, so that they are no longer considered a minion. The minion must be present on the loaded neighborhood somewhere for you to do this. It will also apply the functionality of Dismiss, so that they'll be sure to leave, as opposed to getting stuck in a role.</li>

              <h4>Mastery</h4>
              <p>When you've reached Level 10 in White Arts or Black Arts and have maxed Alignment of the related type, you can choose from one of three rituals under the menu Devote Yourself to the Light/Dark to lock your alignment and gain a special trait in the process. They are as follows:</p>
              <p>Light</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="patch-note">Ritual of Transcendence: +50 Fine Buff that can be toggled at will.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Salvation: Special Ability <b>Sacrifice Magical Connection</b> under White Arts menu; tank your Magical Connection and fill all of the target's needs to full. Target can be Toddler and up.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Creation: Special Abilities <b>Create Life inside Target</b> and <b>Create Life inside Self</b> under White Arts menu; target another sim and make yourself or them pregnant. Target can be Young Adult and up.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Additionally, all Light traits unlock the optional toggle Purity's Aura and optional toggle Hover walkstyle. With Purity's Aura active, the Sim will have a sun VFX in the middle of their chest and nearby Sims will come to them and cheer for them, like a famous person being mobbed.</p>
              <p>Dark</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="patch-note">Ritual of Eternity: Become Immortal, aka: Can't age or die.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Ritual of Might: Special Ability <b>Fight for Llamadeus's Favor</b> under Mean menu; drains the target's needs and fills your Magical Connection. Target can be Teen and up.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Ritual of Wealth: Special Ability <b>Wealth from Death</b> under Black Arts menu; kill the target and gain 50,000 Simoleons. Target can be Teen and up.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Additionally, all Dark traits unlock the optional toggle Reaper's Aura and optional toggle Hover walkstyle. With Reaper's Aura active, the Sim will have a Grim Reaper black smoke VFX by their feet and nearby Sims will run away and panic. While said Sims are panicking, the Sorcerer can use "Scare" on them, which will cause them to pee themselves.</p>

            </div>
            <div id="subsection-child">
              <h4>Child</h4>
              <p>Child Sim Sorcerers can't cast Spells yet. In the wise words of a petulant child, &quot;Maybe later.&quot;&#160;</p>
              <p>Child Sim Sorcerers have a different relationship with magic than older sims. They have a lot of magical energy, but don't understand how to use it yet. Sometimes this can manifest in the form of Spontaneous Combustion. Spontaneous Combustion works as follows:</p>
              <p>Spontaneous Combustion: When Angry, there's a chance that your Child Sim may spontaneously combust, i.e. catch on fire.</p>
              <p>The exact numbers for chance of it happening are: Minimum 4 hours initially, maximum 8 hours initially. Then min 6 hours, max 24 hours. It's intended to be rare overall, rather than being something you habitually have to deal with. But let's keep it moving before we catch on fire here...</p>
              <p>After spontaneously combusting at least once, Child Sim Sorcerers can ask an older Sim who is a Sorcerer to do a Flame Containment Spell on them, which protects them from spontaneously combusting for two days. This buff is called Combustion Suppression and when it's added, all Tense, Angry, and Uncomfortable buffs are removed. (This does not apply to buffs that are dependent on something other than time remaining, like the low Hygiene discomfort from being dirty after being on fire, nor does it apply to buffs of these types that are added AFTER Combustion Suppression is added.)</p>
              <p>Child Sim Sorcerers can also Teleport, with some heavy caveats. For a Child Sim to be able to Teleport, a Teen+ Sorcerer needs to do the interaction with them, under Friendly, called &quot;Imbue with Teleportation Power.&quot; Upon completion, the Child Sim Sorcerer (let's just call him Bob... that's easier to type... Bob is an easy name). Upon completion, Bob gains a 6 hour, +2 Fine buff called Teleporty Tingles. Bob can now click on the ground and use Teleport as Llamadeus's Torch.&#160;</p>
              <p>The catch is, when Bob teleports he'll get a 30 second, +3 Uncomfortable Moodlet called Queasy. While Queasy is active, Bob can't Teleport. His little Bob body isn't built for such speed. Once Queasy drops, Bob can Teleport again, provided he still has the Teleporty Tingles buff.</p>

              <h4>Toddler</h4>
              <p>Like Child Sims, Toddlers can't cast Spells. They can't spontaneously combust either. So what can they do?</p>
              <p>What they can do is use the Lump of Clay to get the Sorcerer trait. Once they have it, they will have a new interaction available if you click on them called "Play." They can do it autonomously, so let me know if you feel that it happens too often.</p>
              <p>This interaction, like the connotation of the word "play," is for "fun." It doesn't do anything other than look cute and give them some Fun Need. It looks magical though, so there's that. Weirder stories!</p>
              <p>Toddlers can also be teleported by older Sims and will get a buff specific to their Toddler trait as a result.</p>

              <ul>
                <li class="patch-note">stats.set_skill_level Triplis_Sorcerer_LightSkill 10</li>

              <p>You can also have Magical Connection be maxed out all the time. Shift-click your Sim and use Spells > Magical Connection to lock it at full.</p>

              <h4>FAQ</h4>
              <p>Q: How do supernaturals interact with one another?</p>
              <p>A: Sorcerers can't drain/sacrifice needs with one another, or with the grim reaper (and a few special active roles, like yoga instructor). They also can't do it to Vampires or Plant Sims; this is simply because Vampires and Plant Sims have different Needs and it would be an obnoxious level of complexity trying to factor in all of the different scenarios. Also, Vampires cannot become Sorcerers, but Plant Sims have been given two of the three ritual options to become one. The reason for these restrictions is just the messy nature of handling the different unique Needs.</p>
              <p>Q: Is anything autonomous? Will there be Sorcerers running around in my game randomly?</p>
              <p>A: Nothing is autonomous. Every interaction is set to not allow autonomy and no one should be getting the Sorcerer Trait without you making it happen (with the exception of Inheritance - See the section <a href="#subsection-inheritance">Inheritance and Club Filters</a> for details on that optional add-on). As Supernatural Sims are a touchy area when it comes to autonomy, I decided at the beginning to stick to this, so peoples' games wouldn't become overwhelmed by autonomous Sorcerers.</p>
              <p>Q: I can't start a fire / my fire isn't working in X area.</p>
              <p>A: Fires can't be started outside the Build Mode zone of a lot. If you are unsure where this begins and ends, go into Build Mode for the lot you're on and you'll see the outline. I also added some restrictions and a tooltip, so that this should be communicated better in-game for fire-starting abilities.</p>
              <p>Q: My sim has a red/orange/yellow Plumbob above their head when they have Dark Alignment progress. Is this normal?</p>
              <p>A: As far as I'm aware, there is no known way to change this with modding, but it's nothing to be concerned about either. The Plumbob changes color because Alignment uses the Needs coding and that coding signals your Need being low with a Plumbob color change. Because Dark Alignment uses the lower end of a Need (it not being full) it shows up as a different color.</p>
