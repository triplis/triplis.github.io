        <h1>FEATURES</h1>
        <div id="subsection-become-sorcerer">
          <h3>How to Become a Sorcerer</h3>
          <p>To obtain the Sorcerer Trait on a particular sim, you need to go into Build Mode and place a Suspicious Lump of Clay anywhere on the Lot (this is a variation on the Lump of Clay added through the mod).</p>
          <p>The Suspicious Lump of Clay has one interaction on it: Investigate Object. The tooltip says the consequences of investigating may be permanent, but with 2.0 and beyond, you can remove the trait using the Suspicious Lump of Clay.</p>
          <p>When the interaction completes, your sim will now have a new hidden trait and a Spells menu with a toggle "Show/Hide Magical Energy Tingles," even if they are as young as Toddler. Toddler and older can get the trait, but Toddlers and Child sims have a different (and very limited) experience. Teen or older gets access to all the main features of the trait.</p>
          <p>See the Toddler and Child sections respectively for information on how the trait works for them. The rest of the mod info will be based on sims who are Teen or older.</p>
          <p>Now that you have the trait, clicking on your Sim will reveal a new menu called Spells. Under Spells, you'll see a menu called "Meditate on the Spirit of Llamadeus..." Under this menu, you'll see three interactions: Ritual of Digestive Control, Ritual of Runner's Vigor, and Ritual of Forced Isolation. Hovering over each tells you what it gives you, uniquely. </p>
          <p>You can only complete one Ritual and it will define what flavor of Sorcerer you end up with, in terms of Needs. Every type gets two new Needs called Magical Connection and Alignment. These two Needs replace two of the six default Needs. The rituals and traits are as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">Ritual of Digestive Control gives a trait called Iron Insides. With Iron Insides, Bladder and Hunger are replaced by Magical Connection and Alignment.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Ritual of Runner's Vigor gives a trait called Never Bedheader. With Never Bedheader, Hygiene and Energy are replaced by Magical Connection and Alignment. [To avoid some weird bugs, Hygiene decays very slowly instead of being locked at max. I may explore an alternative to this in the future.]</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Ritual of Forced Isolation gives a trait called Sociolite. With Sociolite, Fun and Social are replaced by Magical Connection and Alignment.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Once you've chosen a Ritual and completed it, your sim can begin being a Sorcerer!</p>
        </div>
        <div id="subsection-become-sorcerer-neutralish">
          <h3>How to Become a Sorcerer (Sorcerer needs out of sight and mind)</h3>
          <p>Instead of one of the three rituals named in the previous section, you can instead choose Ritual of Neutrality. This option will add Magical Connection and Alignment, but they'll be pushed down out of view and locked in place (Magical Connection locked at full and Alignment locked at a neutral, middle level, something like 0). You will still be able to pursue the Dark and Light skills, just without any managing of the Magical Connection Need or impact from alignment going light or dark. You won't be able to do the alignment lock rituals if you go this route, for obvious reasons.</p>
          <p>This option can be used by Plant Sims and Vampires, as well as normal Sims. If you do a supernatural, make sure you do it in the order of becoming the supernatural then doing Ritual of Neutrality. Otherwise, you may see some weird, undefined behavior with the sorting of the Needs in the UI.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="subsection-alignment">
          <h3>Alignment</h3>
          <p>Alignment functions similarly to the Vampire Energy Need. It doesn't decay and it only changes based on casting Spells. Each time a Light or Dark spell is cast, Alignment increases by 10 points (Light) or decreases by 10 points (Dark), impacting your experience as a Sorcerer.</p>
          <p>Alignment impacts how fast you gain Light/Dark skill and how fast you make friends/enemies with other Sims.</p>
          <p>Spells cost 5 Magical Connection by default. As you progress in Alignment, spells go up in cost for the opposing side. It progresses at a rate of +2 cost for every 10 Alignment. For example, if you reach -50 Dark Alignment, that's 2x5=10. So now if you cast a Light Spell, it will cost 5+10=15 Magical Connection. At -100 Dark Alignment, a Light Spell will cost a total of 25 Magical Connection.</p>
          <p>If you use an Alignment-Lock Ritual (see the section <a href="#subsection-mastery">Mastery</a> for details), your spell cost for that Alignment is now 0. For example, if you reach Max Dark Alignment, Level 10 Black Arts skill, and use the Ritual of Eternity, casting Dark Spells will now cost 0 Magical Connection. Light Spells, on the other hand, will have another +25 cost, totaling it to 50 Magical Connection for each Light Spell. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="subsection-gf-reputation">
          <h3>Get Famous Reputation</h3>
          <p>If you have Get Famous, performing alignment-oriented spells in public will affect your reputation. Light spells will give Good reputation and Dark spells will give Bad reputation.</p>
          <p>Mischief Arts will give some Bad reputation, with the amount depending on whether the spell is Single-target (small), Burst (medium), or Mass (large). See the Spells Mischief section for details on the ways that high Skill Mischief Arts Sorcerers can impact their reputation loss.</p>
          <p>As of V2-5-0, you can gain a very small, not very noticeable amount of fame through spells in some very specific circumstances. If you target a Sim in public who is 2 or more fame levels higher than you with a spell (White Arts, Black Arts, Mischief Arts) you should get a little bit of fame. This was only implemented for spells where you are targeting another Sim with a spell by clicking on them. Picker interactions and other types don't have any such fame integration at this time.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="subsection-magical-connection">
          <h3>Magical Connection</h3>
          <p>Unlike Alignment, Magical Connection works more or less like a normal Need, with some consequences for letting it get too low. When it gets moderately low, you get a +3 Dazed Moodlet. When it reaches rock bottom, you get a +40 Dazed Moodlet. And if it gets too low, you won't be able to cast most spells. Like Vampire Power, Magical Connection is the "power cost" Need. Casting a spell costs you Magical Connection.</p>
          <p>To fill the Magical Connection Need, you can use Practice (click on your Sim and find Practice under Black Arts or White Arts). Later on in Specializations Spells, you'll have an alternative way for each Specialization to refill Magical Connection. They are: Domination = "Drain Needs (Instant)", Destruction = "Show Reaper Garb (gain Magical Connection passively over time)", Greed = "Enchant to Steal Money from Vault", Empowerment = "Sacrifice Needs (Instant)", Deification = "Lock Magical Connection", Creation = "Instant Ready to Evolve"</p>
          <p>Note that Magical Connection only goes down from using Spells (doesn't decay naturally on its own). This was changed in version 3.0 to accommodate the greatly increased number of possible spells to unlock or use.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="subsection-specializations-overview">
          <h3>Specializations Overview</h3>
          <li class="patch-note">Light and Dark spellcasting is now centered around 6 Specializations, 3 for each Alignment.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Rather than being visible skills, Specializations operate in "ranks" and they can decay (but very slowly). After 2 sim days of no usage, you'll get a warning that your Specialization is going to start decaying soon. 2 sim hours after that, it will begin decaying. To give you a sense of the decay speed, if you were at the cap of XP in a Specialization, it would take about 9 sim days (including the time it takes for the decay to start) to go from capped XP to 0. To reset the decay to another 2 sim days before starting to decay, all you have to do is use a spell that belongs to the Specialization in question.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">When you click on your sim, under each Specialization in its pie menu, you'll see an interaction that says "Current Rank: X", where X is the rank you are at. For example, at the beginning, it will say "Current Rank: None." After obtaining the first rank, it will say "Current Rank: Student" and so on. If you click on this interaction, it will trigger a notification that tells you a few things about your rank: How much XP you have, how much XP you need to have to retain your current rank, and how much XP you need to reach the next rank. Despite Specializations not being visible in the UI, I wanted to make sure you can manage them nonetheless and this was an important part of that.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Every time you cast a spell, you will get XP relating to the Specialization menu it was found under. For example, casting Enchant to Kneel, under the Domination menu, will give you Domination XP. As you reach new ranks of a Specialization, you'll unlock more spells. The amount of XP needed for each rank goes up some as you progress, but you can also get more XP from spells as you increase your Black/White Arts Skill. If you want to subvert the XP and/or decay system entirely, you can (with testingcheats enabled) shift-click on your sim and use a variety of Cheats under the "Spells (Cheat)" menu.</li>
        </div>
        <div id="subsection-specializations-spells">
          <h3>Specializations Spells</h3>
          <p>Note that when I say "Rank 1" for spells, technically, these spells are available at Rank 0 (the one that shows up as "Current Rank: None"). I list them as Rank 1 because they are what you will be notified about the first time you rank up and you only need to cast one spell in a Specialization to reach Rank 1.</p>
          <h3>Domination</h3>
          <p>Rank 1</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">Drain Needs (bonded): Drain a sim's needs over time, filling up your own. You can drain any of the six default needs (Fun, Social, Hunger, Bladder, Hygiene, and Energy). Target can be Teen and up.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Enchant to Kneel (targeting a sim or targeting the ground): Target will kneel in place if targeting a sim, or go to the place you clicked on and kneel there if you targeted the ground. Target can be Child and up.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Enchant to Lie Here (targeting a bed): The chosen sim will relax on the bed. Target can be Child and up.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Enchant to Sit Here (targeting a couch, chair, bench): The chosen sim will sit down on the chosen place. For the most part, you should still be able to socialize with the target while they are in this state. Target can be Toddler and up.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Rank 2</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">Induce Panic (targeting a sim): The target will panic in place, slowly losing energy. Target can be Child and up.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Induce Panic About Object (targeting an object): The chosen sim will panic about the object, blocking anyone from using it for the duration. Target can be Child and up.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Induce Panic About Sim (targeting a sim): The chosen sim will panic about the targeted sim for about one sim hour, causing the targeted sim to lose relationship with nearby sims periodically for the duration.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Induce Panic (available on the Piano with Piano skill 10): Plays a song, nearby sims will panic while it's playing and eventually pass out.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Rank 3</p>

(Note: You can use this on Teen or older if they are a played sim and Young Adult or older if they are an NPC. This is to avoid an LE error / failure of the interaction, due to some sort of limitation of the personality change tuning that I didn't want to spend a ton of time trying and failing to address. I may see if there's a way around it in the future.)</li>

As I was working with / waiting on some translators already, I decided to use the plant string Attempt to Increase Evolution for now rather than try to stuff another string in. I will likely correct this so it's more clear in a future update.)</li>

          <h3>Spells Mischief Arts</h3>
          <p>You start with access to the Skill Level 1 spells. To begin progressing in Mischief Arts skill, you can use the Skill Level 1 spells listed below. The Mischief Arts is best paired with the Ritual of Neutrality, added with V2-4-11. It can be played with the other rituals too, though it doesn't impact, or is impacted by, Alignment or Magical Connection.</p>
          <p>Some of these Spells require Seasons or Get Famous and may not appear at all if you don't have those expansions. Some may appear, but won't do anything if you don't have the expansion in question. Generally speaking, anything involving weather (Seasons) or reputation (Get Famous) requires those expansions.</p>
          <p>This is a departure from my normal MO of trying to make everything base game compatible. The reason is, quite a few fundamental features of Mischief Arts were inspired by features from Seasons and Get Famous, and I wanted to see what I could do with the possibilities opened up by those expansions.</p>
          <p>If you are missing one or more of those expansions, the mod should still be compatible with your game, the same as before. You just won't be able to get the full experience if you pursue the Mischief Arts.</p>
          <p>Skill Level 1</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">Apply Random Hairstyle (self target picker): The picked Sim will get a temporary buff that gives them a random hairstyle/color. This buff is temporary and should not have a permanent impact on the Sim's appearance in any way.</li>

            <li class="patch-note">Summon Swarm of Bees / Summon Mini Storm Cloud (target): Visual effect and name is slightly different depending on whether the current Season is Warmer (Spring, Summer) or Colder (Fall, Winter). Target will run around the neighborhood, being chased by bees (Warmer Season) or a mini storm cloud (Colder Season).</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Introduce to Imaginary Friend (target): Target will talk to an imaginary person for a while.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Change Social Context (Funny, Awkward): Must be a targeted Sim you are introduced to. Will change the current social context (if you are unfamiliar with the terminology, that's the part at the top, indicating how the conversation is going). You can change it in a variety of ways as you get higher in skill, opening up the ability to influence the conversation context in most possible ways a conversation can be.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Telepathy, Create Telepathic Connection (target): The target will become a telepathic "hub," meaning that telepathy-based interactions can pick them as a target.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Telepathy, Remove Telepathic Connection (target): Remove the trait that makes the target a telepathic hub.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Telepathy, Chat (self target picker): Picked Sim must be a telepathic hub. Your Sim will look like they are chatting with someone imaginary. Social Need will go up for both Sims (your Sim and the Picked Sim).

            <li class="patch-note">Change Weather (self target): Can change the weather to Cold, Hot, Clear Skies, or Cloudy Skies.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Change Social Context (Friendly, Suggestive, Boring): Must be a targeted Sim you are introduced to. Will change the current social context.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Change Weather Forecast (self target): Can change the weather forecast in a variety of ways, depending on what Season it is. The number of possible ways should be the same as the weather machine.</li>

          <p>Skill Level 3</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">Fuse Components Together (target must an object that is breakable): Breaks the targeted object. Note that a couple of objects have a special state for brokenness that I accounted for. If you notice any objects where breaking it seems to break it in an unexpected way (repairing it won't work or some such thing), let me know. I tried to cover as many breakable objects as I could think of and didn't find the time to test all of them in detail.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Change Walkstyle, Pee Walk, Sleepy Walk, or Panic Run (self target picker): Temporarily changes the Picked Sim's walkstyle to the one you chose out of the three possible variations. Should override most walkstyle priorities, with some exceptions.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Change Social Context (Very Awkward): Must be a targeted Sim you are introduced to. Will change the current social context.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Telepathy, Play (self target picker): Picked Sim must be a telepathic hub. Your Sim will look like they are dancing with no one. Fun Need will go up for both Sims (your Sim and the Picked Sim). Mischief Arts will go up for the caster and for the Picked Sim (if they are a Sorcerer who can progress in Mischief Arts Skill).</li>

          <p>Skill Level 5</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">Induce Extreme Laughter (target): Gives the target a 4h, +50 Playful moodlet, making them dangerously Playful, assuming they are of an age where such is dangerous. If they are younger (ex: Toddler, Child, Teen), they will just be highly Playful, no danger.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Change Weather (self target): Can change the weather to Blizzard, Rain, Thunderstorm, Snow, or Heatwave.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Change Social Context (Distasteful, Tedious): Must be a targeted Sim you are introduced to. Will change the current social context.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Telepathy, Nap (self target picker): Picked Sim must be a telepathic hub. Your Sim will use the same animation as the one used in the Sleep on Ground mod. Energy Need will go up for your Sim like a normal Nap, with an additional minor Energy gain for both your Sim and the Picked Sim. Mischief Arts will go up for the caster and for the Picked Sim (if they are a Sorcerer who can progress in Mischief Arts Skill).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Skill Level 6</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">Apply/Remove Blame Disguise (self target): Prevents reputation loss from performing Mischief Arts spells in public that would normally give a loss to reputation.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Burst of Change Walkstyle, Pee Walk, Sleepy Walk, or Panic Run (self target): Any Sim within range of the spell, with the exception of the caster, will be impacted by its effect.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Change Social Context (Amorous): Must be a targeted Sim you are introduced to. Will change the current social context.</li>

            <li class="patch-note">Enchant Locks to Open (target must be a residential door on a lot that is not your own): Works exactly like the Vampire house entry ability. Grants you entry to a residential home that is not your own, without being invited in.</li>

            <li class="patch-note">Mass Apply Random Hairstyle, Shrink Bladder, Summon Swarm of Bees / Summon Mini Storm Cloud, Introduce to Imaginary Friend (self target): Every currently loaded Sim who can normally qualify as a target of the ability in question, with the exception of the caster, will be impacted by its effect.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Add/Remove No Mischief Mark (self target picker): Makes the Picked Sim immune to most Mischief Arts spells. More specifically, it nullifies the effects of spells that have a Burst and Mass version. This is so that if you want to effect most Sims with a large impact spell, but you want one or more in particular to be immune to the effect, you can set up something like that.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Change Social Context (Insufferably Tedious): Must be a targeted Sim you are introduced to. Will change the current social context.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Skill Level 9</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">Attribute Blame to (self target picker): The Picked Sim will temporarily get some blame when you cast Mischief Arts spells in public. More specifically, spells that would cause a loss in reputation will cause the Picked Sim to lose some reputation as well. Enjoy tanking the reputations of Sims you don't like!</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Mass Change Walkstyle, Pee Walk, Sleepy Walk, Panic Run (self target): Every currently loaded Sim who can normally qualify as a target of the ability in question, with the exception of the caster, will be impacted by its effect.</li>

          </ul>
          <p>Skill Level 10</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">Apply/Remove Blame Reversal (self target): With this active, Mischief Arts spells that would normally cause a loss in reputation will cause a gain in reputation instead. Negative flipped to positive, in other words. Note: This does NOT impact the "Attribute Blame to" interaction. That interaction will still cause a reputation loss for the Picked Sim, not a reputation gain.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Mass Induce Extreme Laughter (self target): Every currently loaded Sim who can normally qualify as a target of the ability in question, with the exception of the caster, will be impacted by its effect.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Enchant Boss to Promote (self target, must have a career): Instantly promotes your Sim. Much like the trickster gods in so many tales, your Sim has the ability to influence their job status and move up in the world easily. Enjoy being ridiculously powerful!</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Change Social Context (Steamy): Must be a targeted Sim you are introduced to. Will change the current social context. In case you're wondering, this is the strongest Romance social context and this interaction will cap it out at the highest amount, making Romance a breeze (or, well... far easier).</li>

          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="subsection-spells-neutral-minion">
          <h3>Spells Neutral - Minion System</h3>
          <p>The Minion system operates under the pie menu category Spells > Minion. Most commands are done by targeting another sim. A few (which I'll specify below) are used by targeting yourself and picking a sim to apply the command to.</p>
          <p>Minion Roles are the core of the minion system. They specify what limitations are set on the minion, while the role is active.</p>
          <p>As of version 3-1 or later, you can toggle "Enable/Disable Ignore Weather." With "Ignore Weather" enabled, the minion will ignore weather as a mechanic completely.</p>
          <p>As of version 3-0 or later, you can toggle "Enable/Disable Always Minion." With "Always Minion" enabled, the minion will enter the minion role upon entering a lot, no matter when or where (this includes being summoned!). Note that some priorities could override it, but the minion will probably enter the role even if other roles are applied, applying whatever behavior restrictions may be toggled on, in the process. Such restrictions could cause conflicts with other priorities, so be wary of, for example, applying it to a restaurant worker.</p>
          <p>As of version 2-5-1 or later, some changes have been made to allow more flexibility in applying minion roles/uses and mixing things up in the way you want them to be. You can get a little more creative with it than in the past.</p>
          <p>Instead of choosing one role over another, most roles can now be combined, toggling them on/off at will. The exception to this is the Guest role and Restricted mode. When a sim is Restricted, they will only do the narrow behaviors allowed by any active roles. Guest is a role that is NOT narrow and is meant to allow most normal sim behavior, so it automatically deactivates Restricted mode and vice-versa.</p>
          <p>You can now also Set Mood of the minion to any mood.</p>
          <p>The following are the roles you can toggle on/off (note that Romance role has been removed, but you can get the same result by combining Guest and setting the minion's mood to Flirty).</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">Dance: The minion will follow around the sim who applied the role to them and dance near them. If more than one Sorcerer has control over the same minion, the minon may pick one or the other at random to dance near.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Guest: The minion, if on a residential lot, will treat it as if they are a welcome guest. If they are not on a residential lot, they will likely just perform whatever range of actions is normal.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Maid: The minion will clean things up if there is anything to clean.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Musician: The minion's Guitar, Violin, and Piano skills will be immediately set to max level. They will play Guitar, Violin, or Piano if one is available to play.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Painter: The minion will paint if there is an easel available to paint on.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Repair: The minion will repair broken objects if there are objects available to repair.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Gardener: The minion will tend to plants in need of care.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Some general details about how Minions work:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">Only NPCs (uncontrolled sims) can have minion commands used on them.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Minions with a role active can be chatted with normally, though they may interrupt chatting to do whatever action is high priority for them, if available.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Minion Needs are locked at max while a role is active, so you don't need to be concerned with managing their needs.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">PlantSims and Vampires can be minions, in addition to normal sims. Sorcerers cannot.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Minions with a role active will always use the Run walkstyle, making them super efficient at getting around to perform their role. Note: Vampires may use super speed or teleport instead of Run, if it's active when they take on a minion role.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Minion roles can be applied on public lots, though they were designed with residential in mind, so they may not be all that interesting outside of the home.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">A minion will stay in its active role forever, unless: 1) You use Dismiss on it or, 2) You leave the lot and the minion leaves the role for some reason that I don't have a fix for. Minions may stick around if you travel, they may not. Expect some inconsistency with this aspect of it. Minions will leave the role if *they* travel, for sure.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Once a role has been successfully applied to a target once, that target will have a permanent relationship bit with the Sorcerer who made them a minion, even if they don't have any roles currently active. This relationship bit can be removed with the ability Release, explained in detail below in the special commands.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Upon exiting their special Sleep interaction, a minion's needs are all set to full. This is to ensure that they aren't staying low somehow, as the result of (for example) a Sorcerer instant drain interaction.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Special minion commands (these commands are always available for a Sorcerer who has made the target into a minion at least once):</p>
          <p>Targeting the Minion</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">Sleep: Puts the minion into a sleeping interaction. This is to allow you to go into the highest game speed, without the presence of minions screwing it up. To wake the minion from this, target them with a sorcerer and use Wake Up.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Dismiss: Forces the minion to leave the lot. In case you're wondering, this can be used on both residential and public lots.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Targeting Yourself and Picking a Sim</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">Summon: Works like the voodoo summon ability. Can only be used on a minion who isn't currently on the loaded neighborhood somewhere. It will bring them onto the lot, to you (they may have to walk/run to you once they spawn, so don't expect to see them instantly). They may try to run off immediately after being summoned; this is because they can be summoned even if at work or occupied with something else like that. You'll want to watch for them and apply a minion role when you see them, to make sure they don't run off. (Note that if you have "Always Minion" enabled, you shouldn't have to worry about them trying to run off when summoned anymore.)</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Release: Removes the relationship bit between Minion and Sorcerer, so that they are no longer considered a minion of that sorcerer. The minion must be present on the loaded neighborhood somewhere for you to do this. It will also apply the functionality of Dismiss, so that they'll be sure to leave, as opposed to getting stuck in a role.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Sleep (can pick up to 7 minions at a time): Tells the minion(s) to go into their special Sleep interaction.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Wake Up (can pick up to 7 minions at a time): Tells the minion(s) to Wake Up from their special Sleep interaction</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Targeting the Ground</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">Sleep (can pick up to 7 minions at a time): Tells the minion(s) to go to the location you clicked on and then go into their special Sleep interaction.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Go Here (can pick up to 7 minions at a time): Tells the minion(s) to go to the location you clicked on.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="subsection-mastery">
          <h3>Mastery</h3>
          <p>When you've reached Level 10 in White Arts or Black Arts, have maxed Alignment of the related type, and have mastered a Specialization of the related type, you can choose from one of three rituals under the menu Devote Yourself to the Light/Dark to lock your alignment and gain a special trait in the process. It will lock the Specialization decay for the chosen type. They are as follows:</p>
          <p>Light</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">Ritual of Transcendence: +50 Fine Buff that can be toggled at will.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Ritual of Salvation: Special Ability <b>Sacrifice Magical Connection</b> under White Arts menu; tank your Magical Connection and fill all of the target's needs to full. Target can be Toddler and up.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Ritual of Creation: Special Abilities <b>Create Life inside Target</b> and <b>Create Life inside Self</b> under White Arts menu; target another sim and make yourself or them pregnant. Target can be Young Adult and up. <i>NOTE: This seems to be incompatible with MC Command Center's MC Pregnancy / MC Woohoo modules, due to the strict rules it applies to pregnancy. I'm aware of the issue, but it's not the simplest thing to fix. I'm not sure if I even can fix it, if MC Command Center's rules are too strict to get around.</i></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Additionally, all Light traits unlock the optional toggle Purity's Aura and optional toggle Hover walkstyle.</p>
          <p>With Purity's Aura active, the Sim will have a sun VFX in the middle of their chest. To activate the component that causes nearby Sims to come to them and cheer for them, like a famous person being mobbed, go to Spells (Cheat) > Reaction.</p>
          <p>Dark</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">Ritual of Eternity: Become Immortal, aka: Can't age or die.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Ritual of Might: Special Ability <b>Fight for Llamadeus's Favor</b> under Mean menu; drains the target's needs and fills your Magical Connection. Target can be Teen and up.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Ritual of Wealth: Special Ability <b>Wealth from Death</b> under Black Arts menu; kill the target and gain 50,000 Simoleons. Target can be Teen and up.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Additionally, all Dark traits unlock the optional toggle Reaper's Aura and optional toggle Hover walkstyle.</p> 
          <p>With Reaper's Aura active, the Sim will have a Grim Reaper black smoke VFX by their feet. To activate the component that causes nearby Sims to run away and panic, go to Spells (Cheat) > Reaction. While said Sims are panicking, the Sorcerer can use "Scare" on them, which will cause them to pee themselves.</p>
          <p>As of version 3-0 or later, there are two new Alignment Lock rituals, one Light and one Dark, Ritual of Radiance and Ritual of Shadows. These require the same things as listed above, with one difference: You need mastery in all three Light Specializations, or mastery in all three Dark Specializations. They also give you access to all three perks/abilities. For example, Ritual of Shadows would give you the traits Fighter, Counterfeiter, and Immortal, and lock Domination, Destruction, and Greed decay.</p>
          <p>As of version 3-1 or later, you can use the Ritual of Infinite Balance to get access to everything and lock everything, light and dark. The requirements for it are: Grandmaster in all specializations, max Light/Dark skill, and Alignment at 0 (the middle). Ritual of Infinite Balance unlocks the abilities:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note"><b>Reveal Type of Sims on Lot</b> (targeting yourself): Temporarily adds a visual to some sims on the lot. Those included are PlantSim, Vampire, Alien, Sorcerer, Good Trait, and Evil Trait. The visual is distinct for each, so that you can recognize what kind of sim they are at a glance.</li>
            <li class="patch-note"><b>Reveal True Form</b> (targeting another sim): Target a Vampire or Alien and force them to change into their undisguised form.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="subsection-child">
          <h3>Child</h3>
          <p>Child Sim Sorcerers can't cast Spells yet. In the wise words of a petulant child, &quot;Maybe later.&quot;&#160;</p>
          <p>Child Sim Sorcerers have a different relationship with magic than older sims. They have a lot of magical energy, but don't understand how to use it yet. Sometimes this can manifest in the form of Spontaneous Combustion. Spontaneous Combustion works as follows:</p>
          <p>Spontaneous Combustion: When Angry, there's a chance that your Child Sim may spontaneously combust, i.e. catch on fire.</p>
          <p>The exact numbers for chance of it happening are: Minimum 4 hours initially, maximum 8 hours initially. Then min 6 hours, max 24 hours. It's intended to be rare overall, rather than being something you habitually have to deal with. But let's keep it moving before we catch on fire here...</p>
          <p>After spontaneously combusting at least once, Child Sim Sorcerers can ask an older Sim who is a Sorcerer to do a Flame Containment Spell on them, which protects them from spontaneously combusting for two days. This buff is called Combustion Suppression and when it's added, all Tense, Angry, and Uncomfortable buffs are removed. (This does not apply to buffs that are dependent on something other than time remaining, like the low Hygiene discomfort from being dirty after being on fire, nor does it apply to buffs of these types that are added AFTER Combustion Suppression is added.)</p>
          <p>Child Sim Sorcerers can also Teleport, with some heavy caveats. For a Child Sim to be able to Teleport, a Teen+ Sorcerer needs to do the interaction with them, under Friendly, called &quot;Imbue with Teleportation Power.&quot; Upon completion, the Child Sim Sorcerer (let's just call him Bob... that's easier to type... Bob is an easy name). Upon completion, Bob gains a 6 hour, +2 Fine buff called Teleporty Tingles. Bob can now click on the ground and use Teleport as Llamadeus's Torch.&#160;</p>
          <p>The catch is, when Bob teleports he'll get a 30 second, +3 Uncomfortable Moodlet called Queasy. While Queasy is active, Bob can't Teleport. His little Bob body isn't built for such speed. Once Queasy drops, Bob can Teleport again, provided he still has the Teleporty Tingles buff.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="subsection-toddler">
          <h3>Toddler</h3>
          <p>Like Child Sims, Toddlers can't cast Spells. They can't spontaneously combust either. So what can they do?</p>
          <p>What they can do is use the Suspicious Lump of Clay to get the Sorcerer trait. Once they have it, they will have a new interaction available if you click on them called "Play." They can do it autonomously, so let me know if you feel that it happens too often.</p>
          <p>This interaction, like the connotation of the word "play," is for "fun." It doesn't do anything other than look cute and give them some Fun Need. It looks magical though, so there's that. Weirder stories!</p>
          <p>Toddlers can also be teleported by older Sims and will get a buff specific to their Toddler trait as a result.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="subsection-lot-traits">
          <h3>Lot Traits</h3>
          <p>You can use two Sorcerer-themed lot traits (but only one at a time on a given lot, they are incompatible with each other).</p>
          <p><b>Dreamland</b>: In the spirit of being dreamlike, sims zoned into a lot with this trait will receive a variety of bonuses and effects that are themed to being helpful or just odd: White Arts skill gain and Light specializations gain are increased; positive moods decay slower; negative moods decay faster; friendly, funny, and romance interactions have a higher chance of success; friendship and romance increases faster and decreases slower; most needs decay slower, with the exception of Energy, which decays faster (it is a sleepy land, after all); child or older sims who aren't ghosts will use a ghost hover walkstyle; and child or older sims who are ghosts will use a regular walk instead of ghost walkstyle.</p>
          <p>Note that the walkstyle override won't necessarily override the walkstyle of a sim every time. It is not the highest possible walkstyle priority, but it's one of the higher ones.</p>
          <p><b>Netherworld:</b> A window into a dark world. Sims entering a lot with this trait (e.g. entering the build mode outline of the lot) will have the following effects applied: Black Arts skill gain and Dark specializations gain are increased; positive moods decay faster; negative moods decay slower; mean interactions are more likely to be used; friendship and romance decreases faster and increases slower; for most sims, most needs decay faster, with the exception of Energy, which doesn't decay at all; Evil and Mean sims will have most needs decay slower and get extra skill gain for all skills; Good sims will have most needs decay even faster than other sims and skill gain will be slower.</p>

          <h3>Removing Sorcerer From a Sim</h3>
          <p>With v3-6-1, I've made the Sorcerer-specific trait removal more thorough when you use the Purge Magic -> Return Magic to Object interaction on the Suspicious Lump of Clay.</p>
          <p>However, due to how complex the mod has gotten, this is still not a complete removal of everything relating to Sorcerer on a specific Sim. Relationships like Subjugate, Empower, and Minion will stick around.</p>
          <p>If you want to remove Sorcerer as thoroughly as possible from a specific Sim without uninstalling the mod and saving over your game with the data missing, I recommend the following steps:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">Use self target "Release" to end the relationship with any Minions and dismiss them from service.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Use self target "Mass -> Dispel Enchantment" to free any Sims trapped in Stasis Field</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Use "Release from Subjugation" on any Subjugated Sims.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Use "End Empowerment" on any Empowered Sims.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Neglecting to do most of this probably isn't going to be very noticeable, since most of the components of the mod depend on you being a Sorcerer for it to matter. The ones I most recommend doing are releasing any Minions from service and any Sims in Stasis Field, so they don't get stuck in the situation.</p>
          <p>I may try to make removal more thoroughly automated in the future, but I wanted to provide something of a guide for now, so if you ever run into issues with components lingering and are confused as to what to do, there's something with some info on it.</p>

        <div id="subsection-faq">
          <h3>FAQ</h3>
          <p>Q: How do supernaturals interact with one another?</p>
          <p>A: Sorcerers can't drain/sacrifice needs with one another, or with the grim reaper (and a few special active roles, like yoga instructor). They also can't do it to Vampires or Plant Sims; this is simply because Vampires and Plant Sims have different Needs and it would be an obnoxious level of complexity trying to factor in all of the different scenarios. Vampires and Plant Sims can become Sorcerers, but their options are more limited; Plant Sims cannot choose the ritual that messes with Bladder and Vampires can only choose the Ritual of Neutrality. The reason for these restrictions is just the messy nature of handling the different unique Needs.</p>
          <p>Q: Is anything autonomous? Will there be Sorcerers running around in my game randomly?</p>
          <p>A: Nothing is autonomous. Every interaction is set to not allow autonomy and no one should be getting the Sorcerer Trait without you making it happen (with the exception of Inheritance - See the section <a href="#subsection-inheritance">Inheritance and Club Filters</a> for details on that optional add-on). As Supernatural Sims are a touchy area when it comes to autonomy, I decided at the beginning to stick to this, so peoples' games wouldn't become overwhelmed by autonomous Sorcerers.</p>
          <p>Q: I can't start a fire / my fire isn't working in X area.</p>
          <p>A: Fires can't be started outside the Build Mode zone of a lot. If you are unsure where this begins and ends, go into Build Mode for the lot you're on and you'll see the outline. I also added some restrictions and a tooltip, so that this should be communicated better in-game for fire-starting abilities.</p>
          <p>Fires also can't be started in most venues (I say most, but it's probably all of them - I just haven't verified each individually). It seems I missed documenting this for a very long time. There is currently no tooltip to convey this. I may look into adding a restriction, so that the interaction won't even show up if the venue has fire disallowed.</p>

        <h1>PATCH NOTES</h1>
        <div id="subsection-patch-notes-v3-6-4">
          <h3>Version 3-6-4</h3>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">Added Sorcerer-themed Lot Traits: "Dreamland": Light lot trait, and "Netherworld": Dark lot trait. Full detail on what to expect from them can be found <a href="#subsection-lot-traits">here</a></li>
            <li class="patch-note">(Requires Get Famous) Added new spells: Greed Level 5 (Grandmaster) "Steal Fame": Transfers the fame of the targeted celebrity to the caster. | Empowerment Level 5 (Grandmaster) "Give Away Fame": Transfers the fame of the caster to the targeted sim. | Destruction Level 5 (Grandmaster) "Destroy Fame": Sets the targeted sim's fame to 0. [NOTE: These spells bypass the rule about not decaying 2 ranks below the maximum you've obtained, so keep that in mind.]</li>
            <li class="patch-note">(Requires Parenthood) Added new Spells: Destruction Level 3 "Corrupt Character Values": If the target has at least one in the positive, at 5 or higher, you can corrupt them, changing them all to -50 (if not already lower). Empowerment Level 3 "Heal Character Values": If the target has at least one at 0 or lower, you can heal them, changing them all to 25 (if not already higher).</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Minion: Added new Toggle Settings option "Enable/Disable Matched Sleeping": A Minion with this enabled will be put to sleep and wake up when their Sorcerer goes to sleep and wakes up. Note: "Meditate In Stasis" is included as a kind of sleep in this context.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Minion: Added new Toggle Settings option "Enable/Disable Needs Unlocked": Normally, Minions have needs locked for convenience. This setting allows you to disable the needs locking, so they can act a little bit more like a roommate, rather than completely superhuman. Recommended that you use this with Guest role if on a residential lot, to ensure the Minion has the right kind of permissions to be able to get their needs met (ex: they are allowed to go Sleep in a bed).</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Minion: "Sleep" and Deification: "Meditate In Stasis" should now count as sleeping more "officially." Did this for the sake of Auto Lights detection, so that, for example, if lights are supposed to go off as a result of them being asleep, these forms of "sleep" will count.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Gave the "Create Sim" interactions a spawn animation and sound effect, for the sim who spawns (previously they just faded in).</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Changed the tagging for "Set On Fire," "Destroy Object," and "Siphon Wealth From..." so they cover a more comprehensive range of objects. (The range is now more like what you'd see in the Spellcaster fire spell, for example.) Note that "Siphon Wealth From..." may not show as an option if the object has a "parent" (e.g. a table has something on it). This doesn't necessarily mean the kind of object can't be siphoned from, you just have to do it in the right order.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Changed the logic for Douse, so it should no longer show up in any erroneous places. (Was showing up on bonfire, which would just cause it to destroy the bonfire object.)</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Fixed an issue where some autonomy (particularly related to Eco Lifestyle and Neighborhood Policy) could get through a Minion being in Restricted mode and cause them to be, well... not as restricted.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="subsection-patch-notes-v3-6-3">
          <h3>Version 3-6-3</h3>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">Mischief Arts "Apply Random Hairstyle" can now select from nine different style categorizations: Any, Long, Medium, Short, Updo, Straight, Curly, Wavy, Bald</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Added Mischief Arts spell "Make Random Hairstyle Permanent": Picked Sim with a temporary hairstyle from Apply Random Hairstyle spell will have that hairstyle applied permanently (*permanent meaning equivalent to going into CAS and changing their hairstyle, as opposed to something that disappears after a few sim hours).</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Removed the tooltip on "Apply Random Hairstyle," since "this spell can't last forever" isn't quite accurate anymore and the existence of "Make Permanent" spell hopefully makes it clear that it is, by default, temporary.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Creation Level 5 (Grandmaster) can now target the ground and create sims under Spells > Create Sim menu (can create Teen or older). Some info/warnings about this: The sim will be created with no household. Spawning a lot of sims at once may be hard on performance and could impact population with regards to culling and the like. Just something to keep in mind.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Domination Level 5 (Grandmaster) can now use Consume Life, filling all of their Needs to fill, in exchange for the life of the targeted sim.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Fixed an issue with a number of self-target picker interactions that would cause the option to not show up if the self-target sim was the only one who qualified as a target.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Away behavior should hopefully be a bit better. Magical Connection can now recover on an away sim if Care For Self is being used.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Related to away behavior, I've hopefully fixed the issue with 'locked' needs like Energy popping up as low on an away sim who is a sorcerer. Needs like this have been set to a decay rate of 0, instead of locked, so with the lock gone, your existing sorcerers may have a period in which they seek out filling one of those hidden needs, but then should stop caring about it once they've filled it the one time. If you still see an issue like this, make sure there is a bed on the home lot (the game checks for that on away action for Energy).</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Sorcerer Removal: In order to make removal more thorough, "Return Magic To Object" now resets Sorcerer Skills and Specializations, so that specializations are at 0 and skills are no longer visible in the skill UI, as if you never had them.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="subsection-patch-notes-v3-6-2">
          <h3>Version 3-6-2</h3>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">Fixed an animation transition issue in the Practice interactions, relating to the optional Animation Replacer. Note: You do NOT need to re-download the replacer script to get this fix. Just the main mod.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">The visual style of Teleport and Enchanted Run is normally determined by Alignment. You can now override this by going to Spells > Visuals and clicking "Movement..." to set a style override. In particular, I made this an option because the neutral rituals stick you with neutral visual, with no way to change the style, since they are stuck at neutral alignment.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Spells (Cheat) Decay lock/unlock for specializations can now be applied more quickly with an "All Sorcerer Specializations" option in each.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Mischief Arts: Apply Random Hairstyle wasn't working at all anymore in my testing. I kinda fixed it, which required changing it so it only changes the style and leaves the color alone. Better than completely broken, I say.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Plumbbob color will no longer turn red if Alignment is a low value, as if you have a low need. (It was never intended to turn red, I just didn't have a way to disable it in the past. I discovered by accident it's possible to change that now.)</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Douse should no longer erroneously show up on fireplaces.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="subsection-patch-notes-v3-6-1">
          <h3>Version 3-6-1</h3>
          <p>This patch comes with the long-awaited (or long-forgotten? ...or long-ago-announced-as-a-possibility-and-abanonded-for-a-very-long-time?)... anyway, optional replacement for animations. You simply use v3-6-1 or later and use the Optional Replacer script and ta-da, your Sorcerer will now be spellcasting like a Spellcaster.</p>
          <p>More detail below:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">Added optional script that replaces (most of) the Sorcerer animations with Spellcaster animations, with some slight variation on the visual effects by alignment (requires Realm of Magic and v3-6-1 or later). Some are untouched because they are a special case, like the animations by Simone Caporalini used in the Bonded interactions, but you can expect standard stuff like casting a dark spell on someone, is changed with the optional script.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Modified some things in the main mod to accommodate the optional script (e.g. using the optional script won't work if you don't get v3-6-1 or later).</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Unrelated to animations, I reevaluated and tweaked sorcerer removal ("Return Magic to Object") to be a bit more thorough; the list of traits to remove had lagged behind updates. I also added an info section to this page, on the details of removing Sorcerer from a specific Sim. The long and short of it is, the mod has for some time been complex to the point where that one interaction isn't as thorough at removing everything as it could be, so in lieu of having complete automated removal, for the time being, I'm providing some details on how to be as thorough as possible if you want to be. You can find that <a href="#subsection-sorcerer-removal">here</a>.</li>

        <div id="subsection-patch-notes-v3-6-0">
          <h3>Version 3-6-0</h3>
          <p>This patch comes with some additions/tweaks to the Minion system.</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">Minions should (hopefully) stick around at home more reliably. If you're away for a while, you may come back to find them at the spawn area in front of the home, but hopefully still there nonetheless.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Added "Always Teleport" toggle: Minion will try to teleport when moving rather than walking or running there.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Added Bartender role: Minion will try to Tend Bar if there is a bar available.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Added Comedian Role: Minion will go for a mic and do comedy if there is a mic available.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Removed NPC restriction on Sleep direct target interaction (so if the Minion is a played sim, you'll still have that Sleep option)</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Added "leave situation" instruction to Release to ensure if the Minion is a played sim, they will leave the situation. NPCs should leave it anyway because they are instructed to leave the lot, but a played sim probably won't leave the lot.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="subsection-patch-notes-v3-5-2">
          <h3>Version 3-5-2</h3>
          <p>This patch comes with redesigned teleports, so that they can be done autonomously. To accomplish this, I had to do some fiddling with the animations and effects, so because of that, they will look a little different (but the spirit of the look is more or less the same).</p>
          <p>Note also that due to them being changed to the kind of teleport that can be done autonomously when toggled on, you can no longer use them to go anywhere; only places the sim could path to with Go Here. (Example: If there are stairs to an upstairs floor, they can teleport to upstairs; if there are no stairs, they can't. This is the same as the vampire and spellcaster teleports).</p>
          <p>Since this is somewhat of a trade in functionality, I've added an additional teleport called Teleport Here (using an existing base game string to avoid the need for new translations) and a custom animation/effect setup that retains the capability of the old teleports to go virtually anywhere, but can't be done autonomously. This way, you can still go anywhere, using the new Teleport Here interaction and you can teleport autonomously with the redesigned old teleports.</p>
          <p>My aim here is to add something, without taking away. I don't want to mess up something people enjoy. :)</p>
          <p>A couple of others miscellaneous changes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">I've removed the script that excluded Minions from most roles. The reason I'm doing this is that upon further examination, it seemed that excluding them from most roles was not helping keep them on the lot you have them on while you're away and was causing unforeseen problems, like excluding them from choosing to travel with; rather than trying to examine all such roles like that and make exceptions for them, I decided to revert the change. I hope that the previous change did not cause anyone issues and that reverting this change will be better overall for Minion gameplay.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">I removed the need for two of the overrides used in the mod by using scripts. In the process, I made it so that in the case of being immune to fire spreading to them, now both sims who have the Aura of Nature active will be immune and so will sims who have the Reaper Garb (from Destruction level 5) active. I felt this was a nice little touch fitting for a destructive sim going on a firey rampage.</li>
          </ul>

        <div id="subsection-patch-notes-v3-5">
          <h3>Version 3-5</h3>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">As another step in allowing the Sorcerer mod to be played alongside Realm of Magic, I've added two optional download files: One causes Sorcerer spells to give Spellcaster XP. The other causes Sorcerer spells to give Spellcaster Charge. You can use one, both, or neither. Completely up to you. I wanted to give as much control as possible over using these options and make it easy to choose. Note that you must use v3-5 or later for these addons to do anything.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">XP Addon: You'll gain some Spellcaster XP each time you cast a Sorcerer spell.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Charge Addon: You'll gain some Charge each time you cast a Sorcerer spell. Note that Charge gain from Sorcerer spells is purely a number gain. I didn't add mechanics for chance of overcharging or success chance of spells. So using Sorcerer spells a lot with the Charge addon will make you more vulnerable to whatever the strengths and weaknesses of Charge may be, relating to casting Spellcaster spells. Sorcerer spells themselves will not be affected by Charge-related strengths and weaknesses.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="subsection-patch-notes-v3-4">
          <h3>Version 3-4</h3>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">As the first step in my efforts to ensure that Become a Sorcerer can be played alongside Realm of Magic, I've added a new version of Ritual of Neutrality that only shows up for sims who are Spellcasters (it's also the only ritual option Spellcasters get after obtaining the base sorcerer trait from the Suspicious Lump of Clay). Unlike the other Ritual of Neutrality, this ritual doesn't give you any special needs, hidden or otherwise. This was done to ensure it can be compatible with the UI priorites of the charge meter that being a Spellcaster gives you. As such, some features may be missing or broken, if they were dependent on Magical Connection or Alignment being present. I already fixed one case of this, the super speed run, but there may be others. Feel free to let me know if you spot other such occurrences.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="subsection-patch-notes-v3-3">
          <h3>Version 3-3</h3>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">Stasis Field should now be working more reliably and consistently again.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Added a Mass version of Dispel Enchantment, found under Spells > Mass. This can be used to dispel Stasis Field easily on a lot of sims at once, if you've used the Mass version of Stasis Field. It will also dispel any other spells that are built to involve the Dispel Enchantment command.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Llamadeus should now be excluded from most random roles that could place her in odd situations or getting her showing up at random once she's been summoned once, that sort of thing.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Minions should now be excluded from most random roles, walkbys, and the like, same as Llamadeus. This was done to try to limit the ways a Minion could get called away from your lot while you're away, to go fill some role on the lot you went to. This will hopefully reduce the instances of a Minion leaving your lot while you're gone. It doesn't reduce it to zero in my testing, but it may help.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="subsection-patch-notes-v3-2">
          <h3>Version 3-2</h3>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">If you're in that weird situation where you chose the Ritual of Neutrality and then somehow or other, you did one of the Mastery rituals and you're like, "What gives? I can't use most of these spells that come from mastery." You should now be able to use those spells.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Added a framework for sims reacting to a spell being casted. Currently, the way this works is you have to manually turn it on per sorcerer in the Spells (Cheat) > Reaction menu. It also has only a 1 in 10 chance of occurring for any given nearby sim, when you cast a spell. I did it this way because it was going to be either this or make it something that is on by default and you can toggle it off per sim. I didn't want to annoy people with something that could turn out to be repetitive and annoying over a long period of time, so instead you can try it out if you want to and if you don't like it, you can just never enable it in the future on your sorcerer sims. If it goes in a direction where people really like it, I might consider trying to work out a way to make it easier to turn on, rather than having to enable it for each individual sorcerer.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="subsection-patch-notes-v3-1">
          <h3>Version 3-1</h3>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">Added new ritual called Ritual of Infinite Balance, requires you to be maxed in everything and have Alignment at the middle, aka: 0. Locks all specializations and gives access to all of the alignment lock perks and abilities, in addition to a couple of new abilities. To rethink this, use the new Ritual of Infinite Indecision.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Added spell Reveal Type of Sims on Lot (requires completion of Ritual of Infinite Balance): Temporarily adds a visual to some sims on the lot. Those included are PlantSim, Vampire, Alien, Sorcerer, Good Trait, and Evil Trait. The visual is distinct for each, so that you can recognize what kind of sim they are at a glance. What you use this for is up to you. I didn't have a specific usage in mind here. I just thought it would be cool to be able to do such a thing and fits the theme of someone who is aligned in the middle.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Added spell Reveal True Form (requires completion of Ritual of Infinite Balance): Target a Vampire or Alien and force them to change into their undisguised form.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Added spell Erase Life (requires Grandmaster Rank 5 Destruction Specialization): Unlike other death spells, no one will react to it having happened. They may react to Grim showing up, but that's it.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Added Mass version of Stasis Field (Mass spells apply to every sim on the lot except the caster).</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Added an additional version of Enchant to Kneel, using a custom animation I made.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Added toggle for Minions "Ignore Weather." Should only show up if you have Seasons installed. Will cause the Minion to ignore weather as a mechanic completely.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Extract Spirit now works for pets on pet urns.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Resurrect can now resurrect pets.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Heal Sickness can now cure pets. (I don't recommend using this on Patient pets at a Vet. It may break the mechanics of how the vet process runs for that Patient, since they technically have no sickness now, but haven't been processed through the system as expected.)</li>
            <li class="patch-note">The toggle-able Fine buff from Ritual of Transcendence now blocks emotions other than Fine, in addition to giving the Fine buff it always has. Given how roBurky's Meaningful Stories mod changes the way Fine influences other buffs, causing a buff like this one to not overpower them in the same way, I wanted it to retain its same power if you are using both Meaningful Stories and this mod.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">The options for "rethinking" a ritual (e.g. when you're committed to light, dark) are now found by shift-clicking with cheats enabled. They are not under the Spells (Cheat) menu, to be clear. The menu they are in is the same as before under Spells, it's just now accessed by shift-clicking with cheats enabled. The goal here is to cut down on menu clutter for something that you probably won't be using often.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">VFX toggles like Magical Energy Tingles are now under Spells > Visuals, to avoid clutter when you click on Spells if you have a lot unlocked.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Reaper's Aura and Purity's Aura are now broken into two different parts: the visual and the reaction. The visual toggle is found under Spells > Visuals. The reaction toggle is found under the Spells (Cheats) menu in a new submenu Reaction (despite being under cheats, the requirements for using it are still the same - I don't consider it 'cheating' to use it, it went there mainly to avoid clutter and I plan to use the Reaction submenu for some other things too).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>3-1b</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">Fixed an issue with strings from the April 16, 2019 patch that caused them to show up as blank, due to how some of them are made. In this case, it only affected the polish strings and strings relating to the Suspicious Lump of Clay, which should now be working again. Thanks to roBurky for spotting what was going wrong with strings in mods.</li>
          </ul>

        <div id="subsection-patch-notes-v3-0">
          <h3>Version 3-0</h3>
          <p>Scripts</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">The mod now uses a script file again. It's imperative for allowing the ability to change a sim's name without going into CAS, as part of the Subjugated Sim "Change Name" Spell (see Domination Specialization notes for more info). Credit and a big thank you to Scumbumbo for creating the script that enabled me to do this and for giving me permission to use it.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Black/White Arts Skill</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">All existing abilities unlocked through these skills have been moved to one of 6 Specializations, 3 Dark and 3 Light: Domination, Destruction, Greed (Dark) and Empowerment, Creation, Deification (Light).</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Black Arts and White Arts do get one new ability each that stays with them and is unlocked at level 10. Imbue with Magic (White Arts) and Strip Magic (Black Arts). These abilities can add (Light) or remove (Dark) the powers of sorcery from the targeted sim.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Instead of unlocking most abilities, Black/White Arts now provides some passive bonuses, as you increase skill, providing higher Specialization XP gain and boosting the success rate of some spells. Practice for these skills is also now the only way to renew Magical Connection early on.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Magical Connection</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">Because there are so many more Light/Dark spells now and so many of them cost Magical Connection, it no longer decays naturally on its own. It only decreases when you cast Spells. Magical Connection can be renewed using the Practice interaction from Black/White Arts. Each Specialization also gets a way to renew magical connection once you reach a high enough level.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Mentoring</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">You can now be mentored in Black/White Arts Skill by a sim who is high enough in the skill, increasing how fast you level them up. This includes being able to ask Llamadeus to mentor you while you are using Practice if Llamadeus has been summoned.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Specializations</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">Light and Dark spellcasting is now centered around 6 Specializations, 3 for each Alignment. You can find the full notes on Specializations and the complete list of spells under the new <a href="#subsection-specializations-spells" target="_blank">Specializations Spells</a> section.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Rather than being visible skills, Specializations operate in "ranks" and they can decay (but very slowly). After 2 sim days of no usage, you'll get a warning that your Specialization is going to start decaying soon. 2 sim hours after that, it will begin decaying. To give you a sense of the decay speed, if you were at the cap of XP in a Specialization, it would take about 9 sim days (including the time it takes for the decay to start) to go from capped XP to 0. To reset the decay to another 2 sim days before starting to decay, all you have to do is use a spell that belongs to the Specialization in question.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">When you click on your sim, under each Specialization in its pie menu, you'll see an interaction that says "Current Rank: X", where X is the rank you are at. For example, at the beginning, it will say "Current Rank: None." After obtaining the first rank, it will say "Current Rank: Student" and so on. If you click on this interaction, it will trigger a notification that tells you a few things about your rank: How much XP you have, how much XP you need to have to retain your current rank, and how much XP you need to reach the next rank. Despite Specializations not being visible in the UI, I wanted to make sure you can manage them nonetheless and this was an important part of that.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Every time you cast a spell, you will get XP relating to the Specialization menu it was found under. For example, casting Enchant to Kneel, under the Domination menu, will give you Domination XP. As you reach new ranks of a Specialization, you'll unlock more spells. The amount of XP needed for each rank goes up some as you progress, but you can also get more XP from spells as you increase your Black/White Arts Skill. If you want to subvert the XP and/or decay system entirely, you can (with testingcheats enabled) shift-click on your sim and use a variety of new Cheats under the "Spells (Cheat)" menu (more on that in its own section below).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Mastery</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">Alignment Lock rituals now require Level 10 Black/White Arts Skill, Max Dark/Light Alignment, and Rank 5 of a Specialization to go with it. For example, Level 10 Black Arts, Max Dark Alignment, and Rank 5 Domination.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Alignment Lock rituals lock the decay for the Specialization in question. They correspond as follows: Transcendence=Deification, Creator=Creation, Savior=Empowerment, Counterfeiter=Greed, Fighter=Domination, Immortal=Destruction</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Added two new Alignment Lock rituals, Ritual of Shadows and Ritual of Radiance. Ritual of Shadows requires mastery in all three dark Specializations, locks their decay, and gives you access to all of their perks/abilities. Ritual of Radiance requires mastery in all three light Specializations, locks their decay, and gives you access to all of their perks/abilities. For example, with Ritual of Shadows, you would get the Counterfeiter, Immortal, and Fighter trait, and have Greed, Domination, and Destruction Specialization decay locked.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Minion</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">New toggle added "Enable/Disable Always Minion." With "Always Minion" enabled, the minion will enter the minion role upon entering a lot, no matter when or where (this includes being summoned!). Note that some priorities could override it, but the minion will probably enter the role even if other roles are applied, applying whatever behavior restrictions may be toggled on, in the process. Such restrictions could cause conflicts with other priorities, so be wary of, for example, applying it to a restaurant worker.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Cheats</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">If you have testingcheats enabled and shift-click on your sim, there is now a new "Spells (Cheat)" menu. In it, you will find a number of cheats for things like setting skills to max, setting Specializations to max or min, and locking or unlocking Specialization decay. You can find the full notes under the <a href="#subsection-cheats" target="_blank">Cheats</a> section.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Miscellaneous</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">A number of spells that were meant to temporarily restrict a target's behavior are more strict now, so the target will have a harder time ending the interaction prematurely. Included are bonded spells like draining needs, sacrificing needs, transferring weight, transferring fat, etc.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Stasis Field is now not only far more strict, but also allows super speed and puts the sim in a looping animation of no movement, so it looks like they are frozen in time.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Teleporting another sim who is Child or older now gives them a temporary Dazed moodlet instead of Tense.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Sorcerers can now teleport Pets, in addition to being able to teleport Human sims.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Aura of Glamour now includes a success modifier for romantic interactions, for the sim who was given the aura. This just means they should be far more effective at having success in romance with the buff active than before.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Suppress Sadness is now a toggle-able buff, rather than a buff with a set duration.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Drain/Sacrifice Need interactions are no longer blocked off if you have locked your alignment, as they are now part of the spells list for Specializations and are thus not "special" in the same way as before.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Another override has been added, overriding the file "bed_relax", so that the target won't get up right away when Enchant to Lie Here is used on them</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Revised the Hygiene Need setup that is part of Never Bedheader, so that it mimics what is used in the base game reward store trait Forever Fresh. It should more reliably keep your sim clean this way, without issues relating to locking the stat that I was trying to work around in the past. This setup is also used in the Lock Hygiene spell that Deification has and has been edited into the setup for minions.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Fixed a tagging issue where I claimed that you could set chairs on fire, but the tag wasn't making the spell appear on chairs as intended. It should now appear on a variety of types of chairs as intended.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Russian translations are up-to-date with v3.0, thank you to Amalenne.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>3-0b</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">Mischief Arts: Fixed picker spells for walkstyle, so that they award XP now.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Fixed an issue in a test that prevented the use and/or breakage of objects from using Mischief Arts: Break Object, or the new Specialization spells Break Objects in Range / Repair Objects in Range, when on a lot that isn't the lot your current sim owns. In other words, they should work the same way no matter what lot you're on now.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Added cheat interactions "Apply Blame Disguise / Remove Blame Disguise" for Black Arts and White Arts. These will prevent reputation gain (Light Spells) or loss (Dark Spells), if that is something you'd rather spells not impact. (Side note for translators and those using translations: This cheat addition does NOT add new strings. It reuses existing strings, so if your language strings are already up-to-date with v3.0, you're good to go.)</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Added Chinese translations, which are now up-to-date with v3.0, thank you to justin10.</li>

          <h3>Version 2-5-1</h3>
          <p>Movement</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">Walkstyle toggles (superspeed, hover) are now found under their own menu, Spells > Movement</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Alignment-locked Sorcerers normally get access to a Hover walkstyle, like the Grim Reaper. They can now also access a Hover walkstyle that is much faster. It's called Hoverjet.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Hoverjet is a much faster version of the Hover walkstyle. I put it in as kind of an experiment, for fun. Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to change the animation itself without errors (only the movement speed), so I don't recommend focusing the camera on it for long. It's kind of jittery-looking due to the speed. I figure if you're just seeing it in the background while you play, it might be fun to use.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Minion</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">The goal of these changes is to allow more flexibility in applying minion roles/uses and mixing things up in the way you want them to be. You can get a little more creative with it than in the past.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Instead of choosing one role over another, most roles can now be combined, toggling them on/off at will. The exception to this is the Guest role and Restricted mode. When a sim is Restricted, they will only do the narrow behaviors allowed by any active roles. Guest is a role that is NOT narrow and is meant to allow most normal sim behavior, so it automatically deactivates Restricted mode and vice-versa.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">The roles available are the same as before, with the addition of Gardener and the removal of Romantic: Guest, Maid, Repair, Musician, Painter, Gardener, Dance</li>
            <li class="patch-note">You can now Set Mood to change the minion's mood. This makes the Romantic role and the mood variations for Dance no longer necessary, so they have been removed.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Call Over is now called Summon.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Fire is now called Release.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Minions are now created with a relationship bit instead of a trait. What this means is, once you've made someone a minion, only the Sorcerer who made them a minion will be able to do the normal commands to them. If you want more than one Sorcerer to have access to the commands on the same Minion, they both need to apply a role or use the option Be Minion on the target. Due to this change, the trait is no longer used, so if you've played with minions in prior versions of the mod, you could lose track of existing minions who are not currently on the lot. To get around this, you can, with testingcheats on, use a Cheat version of the Summon interaction to bring old minions to your lot. Once you've applied a role to them in the new system, they will be set up with the relationship bit.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Now that Minions are created with a relationship bit, Dance target should no longer be lost when reloading the game. The minion will still know who to dance near.</li>

            <li class="patch-note">(since V2-5-0) With the help of a handy program, I can now add new strings much more easily, so a number of things that were using base game strings now have a custom string. For example, the "Boss" menu is now more accurately named "Minion."</li>
            <li class="patch-note">(since V2-5-0) Basic Get Famous fame integration for spells: If you use a targeted spell, in public, on a Sim who is 2 or more fame levels higher than you, you should get some fame. It's very little, so don't expect a clear fame path solely through Sorcery. I just wanted to integrate something for the time being.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">(since V2-4-11) You can now choose the Ritual of Neutrality when picking a ritual for your Sorcerer. See the additional "How to Become a Sorcerer" section for details.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">(since V2-4-10) Get Famous reputation integration: If you perform spells in public, you may lose reputation (dark spells) or gain reputation (light spells). This seemed important to me to do, given the emphasis on light/dark as part of the mod.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">(since V2-4-7) Trait is now obtained through new object "Suspicious Lump of Clay"</li>
