        <h1>Toddler Walk Together</h1>
        <p>Toddlers can walk together with other sims, leading them around, as they wander about with their little toddler legs, getting exercise and building their movement skill.</p>

        <div id="subsection-interactions">
          <h3>Interactions</h3>
          <p>The walk together interaction can be initiated by a toddler targeting child or older, or by a child or older targeting a toddler. Either way, the interaction is the same; the child or older follows around the toddler. You gotta watch those toddlers and make sure they don't get into trouble!</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note"><b>Walk</b>: Builds relationship, toddler movement skill, and fun/attention for the toddler. Becomes Ask to Walk Around if the toddler's Communication Skill is high enough.</li>
            <li class="patch-note"><b>Walk Around Together</b>: Builds relationship, toddler movement skill, and fun/attention for the toddler. Becomes Order to Walk Around Together if the toddler has a particular defiant buff (Child Sims are excluded from this name for the interaction).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Note: Despite being called Walk, the toddler will Run if their movement skill is high enough.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="subsection-issues">
          <h3>Known Issues</h3>
          <p>Every once in a while, there might be a funky thing where the sim following the toddler roams around a bit weirdly before correcting and keeping in step a little behind them as intended.</p>
          <p>Or the sim following the toddler might fail to follow due to some other priority booting them out of the interaction. This isn't necessarily a bug (they could get booted out from something intended, like a Need being critically low). If this happens and you don't want the toddler to keep walking/running around without them, just cancel the toddler's interaction.</p>
          <p>I believe I've squashed a bug I was seeing where the toddler would freeze instead of walking/running around and you'd have to use Reset Object (Debug) on them. But if you have that happen, just make sure testingcheats is on, then shift-click and use Reset Object (Debug). I know that's not exactly confidence-inspiring, but for what it's worth, it was a rare bug to begin with and I haven't been able to repeat it since some tweaks/changes I made to squash various issues that were arising.</p>
          <p>Feel free to hit me up on <a href="https://discord.gg/JhNwtYv" target="_blank">Discord</a> if you think a bug relating to it is happening often, or if you think you've spotted a way to repeat a bug relating to it.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="subsection-installation">
          <h3>Installation and XML Injector</h3>
          <p>This mod is dependent on <a href="http://modthesims.info/d/622928/xml-injector-version-1.html" target="_blank">XML Injector</a>, version 1 or later. XML Injector is a library resource for modders, created and maintained by Scumbumbo, enabling modders to do things like adding interactions to sims without needing their own independent scripts in a mod.</p>
          <p>You only need to install the XML Injector once and then you'll have it for any mods that are dependent on it. This means less script files to deal with overall.</p>
