              <h4>Portal Door object</h4>
              <p>This mod adds a new object to build mode called Portal Door Plain. If you find you can't click on it in Live Mode, don't worry; that's supposed to happen.</p>
              <p>So what <i>does</i> it do?</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="patch-note">If two or more are placed, sims will traverse through them automatically, if using the portal would get them where they are heading faster.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Example 1: You place one on the first floor of a home. You place another on the second floor of a home. Your sim is idling angstily about on the first floor and decides they want to go play on the computer on the second floor. Normally, they would need long and arduous stairs to get up to the computer. With the portals in place, your sim should choose the portal instead, getting upstairs much faster! In fact, you don't even need the stairs.</li>
                <li class="patch-note">Example 2: You've built an extremely extravant and large home on a gargantuan lot. You place one portal on one end of the lot and one portal on the other end of the lot. Your sim is sitting on one end of the lot and decides to go chase down a sim on the other end of the lot to talk to them. Instead of walking all that distance, they choose the portal instead and get there much faster!</li>
              </ul>
              <p>As you can see from the examples, sims should generally be smart enough to choose whatever portal will get them where they're going the fastest, if a portal is available to do so (even if you've ordered them where to go). I can't take any credit for this aspect of it; it's baked into the design of the portal logic that I used. Which brings me to the next section...</p>
              <div class="to-top">
                <p><a href="#main-col">^</a></p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div id="subsection-warning">
              <h4>Mild Warning</h4>
              <p>This isn't one of those warnings where you need to turn around and run in the other direction. It's just one stipulation to be mindful of. The portal logic I used utilizes a tag from one of the Jungle Adventure portal type jungle door thingies. This means almost nothing, surprisingly, and you don't need Jungle Adventure for this mod to work (I tested with it disabled).</p>
              <p>What it does mean is <b>you should be wary of setting up these portals on any of the lots that contain the Jungle Adventure portal type door thingies.</b> It shouldn't break your game or anything, it just may cause your sim to not always quite go where they are expected to go on that lot, i.e. may screw with your experience in trying to get through the portal type jungle door thingies as expected.</p>
              <p>If you were to do this on accident, it shouldn't have any kind of permanent effect; as soon as you removed the door portals, any issues getting around should go away.</p>
              <p>Thus... "mild" warning.</p>
