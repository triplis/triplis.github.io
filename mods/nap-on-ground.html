            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>Can click on yourself and Nap or Sleep. Works like other Nap/Sleep, except you can do it anywhere and just Nap/Sleep on the ground. Teen or older can use it.</p>

              <h4>Nap and Sleep Interactions</h4>
              <p>These interactions are autonomous, which means Sims may do them of their own accord when they are low on Energy Need.</p>
              <p>Sims may Nap, identical to the stats of napping (for example) on a sofa, with the addition that it can be done anywhere and they will do the animation on the ground.</p>
              <p>Sims may Sleep, in most aspects like sleeping on a bed (I suspect the amount of Energy gained may be consistently less, since there is no aspect of "quality" from sleeping on the ground).</p>

              <h4>Two Versions</h4>
              <p>The Maxis animation I used for the Nap part of this mod was evidently not built to accommodate super speed. It looks ok at the fastest waking speed. With the sleeping super speed, it looks jerky and weird. For this reason, I'm including two versions of the mod:</p>
              <p>YesSuperSpeed - Works like other Nap interactions, including being able to go into the fastest game speed</p>
              <p>NoSuperSpeed - Works like other Nap interactions, except you can't go into the fastest game speed</p>
              <p>Only use one at a time (NOT both!).</p>
              <p>(Note: The distinction only applies to the Nap interaction. The Sleep interaction will allow the fastest game speed either way.)</p>

            <h3>V4 Changes</h3>
            <ul>
              <li class="patch-note">(V4-1) Redid the animation so it looks a little smoother/real and there's a bit of an idle while sleeping.</li>
              <li class="patch-note">(V4-1) Fixed up animation frame count and duration (some numbers were off and was causing a delay when transitioning out).</li>
              <li class="patch-note">(V4-1) Fixed a mistake where Sleep showed up when targeting other sims.</li>
              <li class="patch-note">Instead of using its own independent script, this mod is now dependent on Scumbumbo's <a href="https://modthesims.info/d/622928/xml-injector-version-1.html" target="_blank">XML Injector</a>. This might sound odd at first, but you only need to install the XML Injector once and then you'll have it for any mods that are dependent on it. This means less script files to deal with overall. If you are replacing an older version of Nap on the Ground, be sure to delete both the package and the script.</li>
              <li class="patch-note">Added Sleep interaction, along with a custom animation to move into / out of from Corpse Pose, for sleeping.</li>
              <li class="patch-note">Updated Nap interaction to include all of the newer bits that Nap interactions have.</li>
