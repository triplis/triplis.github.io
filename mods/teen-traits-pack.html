        <p><b>Latest:</b> v4.1.3, released after EA Patch, July 26, 2022</p>
        <p>Note: Features with an asterisk next to them involve xpac content.</p>
        <h3>Patch Notes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="patch-note">July 27, 2022: Minor tuning fixes for EA patch.</li>
          <li class="patch-note">November 3, 2021: Fixed an issue with some proximity buffs appearing on siblings that were not intended in that context.</li>
          <li class="patch-note">November 11, 2020: Changed Teen Traits to 32-bit hash. This means any sims who have one of the traits will lose it and you'll have to re-add it in CAS. I know this is an inconvenience, but the traits were previously 64-bit, which causes issues with the new Open Sim Profile way of viewing a sim's info.</li>
          <li class="patch-note">November 11, 2020: Changed versions to just one, rather than base game and xpac. Based on knowledge of the game I have now, I'm fairly confident the few xpac features are not going to cause issues for those who don't have the given pack, so I'm simplifying it to the one download.</li>
          <li class="patch-note">Fixed for some commodity tuning changes.</li>

          <h3>Two Versions</h3>
          <p>The package file comes in two versions: Base Game and Expansions (ONLY USE ONE AT A TIME!). The Expansions version includes references to Nightclub venue, Cafe venue, and DJ Mixing skill from Get Together; Singing skill from City Living; and Organ skill from Vampires.</p>
          <p>If you only have some of the above named Expansions, you are welcome to use the Expansions version anyway. I don't have any reason to believe that issues are guaranteed to crop up (mostly likely the references to expansion stuff will just get ignored by the game), but the possibility of unforeseen issues is there, so fair warning.</p>
