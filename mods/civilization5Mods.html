          <h1>The Sioc</h1>
          <p><b>Latest:</b> v1.0, released Month, Day, 2021</p>
          <p><b>Compatibility:</b> built to work with games that have both Gods & Kings, and Brave New World expansions.</p>
          <p><a href="https://workupload.com/file/fBgWEMPKDEp" target="_blank">Download</a> (note: download may take some time, it's almost 400MB due to the music)</p>
          <p>This mod adds a new fictional civilization loosely inspired by the Celts and the Irish. It's designed to benefit from being played on the coast and has a coastal start bias, with its Lighthouse replacement building that improves coast/ocean tiles and its reduced cost for naval unit maintenance.</p>
          <p>It also includes a new soundtrack I pieced together from a variety of composers who allow their music to be used in non-commercial projects like this.</p>
          <h3>Trait</h3>
          <p>Way of the Storm: Pay 25% less for naval unit maintenance. Culture cost of adopting new policies reduced by 30%.</p>
          <h3>Unique Unit (UU)</h3>
          <p>Gaoth: Replaces the Scout. Starts with +2 Sight and +1 Movement from promotions, making it a faster explorer. Upgrades to Composite Bowman.</p>
          <h3>Unique Building (UB)</h3>
          <p>Oidhreacht: Replaces the Lighthouse. Provides +1 Culture and +1 Happiness. Coast and Ocean tiles in the city provide +1 Production when worked. Additionally, Fish and Whale provide +1 Culture, and Pearls and Crabs provide +2 Culture, when worked. The Oidhreacht counts as a culture building, with regards to the Tradition tree Legalism policy. (Note: These bonuses are in addition to the default features of the Lighthouse.)</p>
          <h3>Strategy</h3>
          <p>The Sioc are designed to be played primarily on the coast. I recommend going for Sailing and Optics early in the game to get access to the Oidhreacht (Lighthouse replacement) and use the reduced maintenance cost on naval units to help keep a ship or two around your strong coast/ocean tiles to prevent them from being blocked or pillaged by barbarians and other civilizations' units.</p>
          <p>If you are trying to rush 3-4 cities at the beginning of the game, I recommend scoping out 3-4 solid coastal spots (at least one Fish, Whales, Pearls, or Crabs tile), if it's possible without hurting yourself on unique luxuries. This is to ensure you'll get at least one "super" tile, boosted by the benefits of the Oidhreacht, in each city. You could also go Tradition, but wait to get Legalism until each city has a Monument built to get a free/instant Oidhreacht in each; though this does run the risk of delaying your first Oidhreacht and losing the precious momentum you can get from having one, or a few, high production / high food tiles in early game, when other civs are still trying to get going.</p>
          <p>I find that God of the Sea is a solid Pantheon to pair with this civ, so long as you've got good tiles to use with the Oidhreacht, as they complement each other. Normally, you probably wouldn't be using or caring about coast/ocean tiles much, but since you are already using them, this pantheon makes that early boost just a little better and makes you stronger in getting important stuff built.</p>
          <h3>Installation</h3>
          <p>Unzip the downloaded file and place the CIV5MOD file in your MODS folder. This is probably located somewhere like: Documents/My Games/Sid Meier's Civilization 5/MODS</p>
          <p>Once you've loaded up the game, click MODS and wait for the mod to load, then enable it by clicking the little circle so it's highlighted. Then click Single Player to start a modded game.</p>
          <p>If the mod is installed and enabled successfully, and you are setting up a modded game, you should be able to choose "Shailyn - The Sioc" from the available civs.</p>
          <p>To uninstall, simply delete or otherwise remove the CIV5MOD file from your MODS folder. You may also want to disable it first in-game, though it doesn't seem to be necessary to do so, it's just cleaner to do it that way probably.</p>
