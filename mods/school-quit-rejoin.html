        <h3>Patch Notes</h3>
        <p>Version 2.0 comes with some changes to address a longstanding nuisance about quitting and joining, which I hope will make the mod more enjoyable to use.</p>
        <p>Previously, the way it worked is I made the school "careers" "quittable", which allowed you to quit/join them through the "job" interface, but also meant that when taking on extracurricular activities, you had to choose that or school.</p>
        <p>What I've done now is they are no longer officially "quittable." Instead, you do a sort of cheat to bypass their quittable status and quit anyway. The result is that you can still quit and you can have school and extracurricular activities at the same time! The result is also that Join/Quit are now done through two new interactions, Join School and Quit School, which show up in phone interactions under Career.</p>
        <p>In Summary:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="patch-note">Join/Quit is now done through Join School and Quit School in Phone interactions under Career.</li>
          <li class="patch-note">You can now be in school and have extracurricular activities at the same time, as is the case without the mod.</li>
          <li class="patch-note">Homework gets added if not in your inventory when you use Join School, so keep in mind if you have homework but it's placed in the world when you join, you could end up with a duplicate. This is just to make sure your sim gets the homework they are supposed to have when they join. I'm honestly not sure if it was an issue with the previous setup, but I ran into an edge case and wanted to make sure you get the homework.</li>
          <li class="patch-note">XML overrides have been replaced with scripts, with the exception of the one loot file that the Optional Addon "UnlimitedPTO" overrides.</li>
          <li class="patch-note">The two different download options have been reduced to one, since the reason for splitting them originally had to do with the "school and extracurricular activities at the same time" limitation.</li>
        </ul>

        <div id="subsection-no-auto-enroll">
          <h3>No Auto Enroll</h3>
          <p>The scripted part of the mod effectively disables auto-enrolling. Whether you reload, travel, or age up Toddler --> Child or Child --> Teen, Sims will never be enrolled in school without your doing it.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, this was the only way I could figure out how to disable it, so it is what it is.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="subsection-quit-join">
          <h3>Quit or Join</h3>
          <p>These are found in the Phone interactions, under Career.</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">Join School: Enrolls the Child or Teen in school.</li>
            <li class="patch-note">Quit School: Removes the Child or Teen from school.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="subsection-ages">
          <h3>Ages</h3>
          <p>Child Sims can't be whisked away from having too low of a Grade. I originally put this in the mod to handle situations where you quit/rejoin a lot and end up with a terrible grade that is hard to get out of and puts your Child Sim close to being taken away. It eventually stuck as a main part of the mod and so I've been keeping it as such, despite it not strictly being necessary since the mod will also prevent you from dropping a grade when you quit.</p>
