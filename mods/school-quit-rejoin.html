        <div id="subsection-no-auto-enroll">
          <h3>No Auto Enroll</h3>
          <p>The scripted part of the mod effectively disables auto-enrolling. Whether you reload, travel, or age up Toddler --> Child or Child --> Teen, Sims will never be enrolled in school without your doing it.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, this was the only way I could figure out how to disable it, so it is what it is.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="subsection-quit-join">
          <h3>Quit or Join</h3>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note"><b>Join School (TEEN)</b>: You can join school by opening up your phone, going to the Career/Household panel, and clicking "Find a Job," or click "Join a Career" under the Career/School panel.</li>
            <li class="patch-note"><b>Quit School (TEEN)</b>: You can quit school by opening up your phone, going to the Career/Household panel, and clicking "Quit Job." The game will prompt you to confirm your decision, the same as if you're quitting a career as an adult.</li>
            <li class="patch-note"><b>Join School (CHILD)</b>: You can join school by opening up your phone and using the "Join After School Activity" option.</li>
            <li class="patch-note"><b>Quit School (CHILD)</b>: You can quit school by opening up your phone and using the "Quit After School Activity" option.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="subsection-ages">
          <h3>Ages</h3>
          <p>Children can't be whisked away from having too low of a Grade. I originally put this in the mod to handle situations where you quit/rejoin a lot and end up with a terrible grade that is hard to get out of and puts your Child Sim close to being taken away; for now, it's the default (and only) up to date version, along with grades not going down when you quit/rejoin.</p>
          <p>Due to how the baked in logic of quitting/joining works for careers in the Maxis Python code, allowing school to be quittable means you can't be in school and add another career on top of it.</p>
          <p>For this reason, I long ago made the different versions ChildTeen and ChildOnly, in case you wanted Child Sims to be able to quit/join school, but keep Teens restricted, thereby keeping their possibility of enrollment in school and career at the same time, intact.</p>
          <p>With Seasons, this same problem now exists for Child Sims with joining an "After School Activity" and being enrolled in school at the same time.</p>
          <p>To create a sort of workaround for this, since the problem now exists for both ages with this mod, I created an optional, additional download, UnlimitedPTO, that makes it so that Child and Teen Sims can take time off from school, one day at a time, without having a limited number of days. I recommend using this as a standalone alternative to the mod if the aforementioned career/school restriction is more important for you to avoid than being able to quit/join school at will.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="subsection-compatibility">
          <h3>Compatibility</h3>
          <p>This mod overrides several game files. Mods that edit the same files will conflict. The files are as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="patch-note">commodity_Career_Child_Neglect | S4_339BC5BD_00000000_0000000000018282</li>
            <li class="patch-note">career_Child_GradeSchool | S4_73996BEB_00000000_000000000000325F</li>
            <li class="patch-note">career_Teen_HighSchool | S4_73996BEB_00000000_0000000000002545</li>
            <li class="patch-note">phone_JoinCareer_Child | S4_E882D22F_0000001A_000000000002EC8A</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Scripting note for other modders: The script to avoid auto enroll edits "_apply_school_career" in simulation\careers\school\school_tuning.py (so any scripts that change the default code for that method will conflict... appending code may or may not)</p>
        </div>
        <div id="subsection-versions">
          <h3>Two Versions</h3>
          <p>The package file comes in two versions: ChildTeen and ChildOnly</p>
          <p>This was a decision I made long ago, so that if you want Child sims to be able to quit/join, but you don't want Teens to have their joint school/career thing mucked with (see <a href="#subsection-ages">Ages</a> section of features for an explanation on this), you can just apply the possibility of quitting to Child sims. Teens will still be affected by the no-auto-enrolling script though.</p>
